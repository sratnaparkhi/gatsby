Take me to your leader! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don&#8217;t own!</p>\n<p><strong>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of &#8216;will&#8217;?</strong> <em> You won&#8217;t have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you&#8217;ll be doing.</em> Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</p>\n<h2>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!</h2>\n<p>Who am I making this out to? You are the last hope of the universe. It doesn&#8217;t look so shiny to me. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Then we&#8217;ll go with that data file!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you&#8217;d cease to exist!</li>\n<li>You don&#8217;t know how to do any of those.</li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</h3>\n<p>Tell her she looks thin. File not found. That&#8217;s not soon enough! Who are you, my warranty?!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ooh, name it after me!</li>\n<li>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire.

We have bigger problems. Oh, you&#8217;re a dollar naughtier than most. Bender, quit destroying the universe! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!</p>\n<p>I never loved you. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Isn&#8217;t it true that you have been paid for your testimony? I could if you hadn&#8217;t turned on the light and shut off my stereo.</p>\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. I&#8217;m a thing. Fry! Stay back! He&#8217;s too powerful! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don&#8217;t pay you or let you go.</p>\n<p>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Who&#8217;s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?</p>\n<p>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I&#8217;m still single? It&#8217;s &#8217;cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Oh dear! She&#8217;s stuck in an infinite loop, and he&#8217;s an idiot! Well, that&#8217;s love for you.</p>\n<p>Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Is today&#8217;s hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Hey! I&#8217;m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</p>\n<p>Ooh, name it after me! And from now on you&#8217;re all named Bender Jr. Fry! Stay back! He&#8217;s too powerful! A sexy mistake.</p>\n<p>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! That&#8217;s the ONLY thing about being a slave. Bender, I didn&#8217;t know you liked cooking. That&#8217;s so cute. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t have a brig. Say what? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I&#8217;ll rest easier not knowing where they are.</p>\n<p>I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! You&#8217;ve killed me! Oh, you&#8217;ve killed me! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? No argument here. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you&#8217;d cease to exist!</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a T. It goes &#8220;tuh&#8221;. Fry! Stay back! He&#8217;s too powerful! You won&#8217;t have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you&#8217;ll be doing. You&#8217;re going to do his laundry? Aww, it&#8217;s true.
