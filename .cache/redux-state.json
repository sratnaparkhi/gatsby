      "title": "Dispelling These 3 Roofing Myths May Save You Money in the Future",
      "content": "\n<p>Your home’s roof is one of your greatest investments and one of the things that may cost you the most in repairs if something should go wrong. From leaks to missing shingles to the invasion of mammal and insect pests, there are many factors that may negatively affect your roof. However, myths about roofing abound as well, and believing them may cost you time and money down the road, too. Discovering the truth about your home’s roof and the facts about its longevity, material, and what you can expect from it may help you protect and lengthen its lifespan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #1: Roofs Do Not Require Regular Maintenance </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think that once you have a roof installed, you can forget about it unless something goes wrong. While it is true that a roof should last for many years when installed correctly, performing spot checks and fixing small issues before they become major ones is vital. For example, if strong winds have blown a few shingles off the roof where you cannot see them missing, the exposed metal flashing underneath may start to corrode and cause leaks. Having a professional perform regular annual checks of your roof may prevent hundreds or even thousands of dollars in repair later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #2: You Can Cover Damaged Shingles With New Ones</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Damaged or broken shingles are a common roofing issue, and you might think that covering them with new shingles will fix the issue. However, this may cause more harm than good. When shingles are damaged, any wood sheathing underneath may be weakened as well. When this thin layer of wood is compromised by wet or cold weather, it can quickly rot and cause a leaky roof.<br>\nInstead of simply nailing new shingles under old ones, have a professional roofing company come out to strip off the damaged shingles and inspect the sheathing. If it has been damaged, repairs should be made by a qualified roofing contractor before new shingles are put into place. Otherwise, a quick fix to your shingles is much like applying a small bandage to a deep wound: it will only cause worse problems as time goes on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Myth #3: Tiled Roofs Need Major Care </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have always wanted a tiled roof but believe they need painting, sealing, and other types of costly maintenance, you can put those worries to rest. In reality, a tiled roof does not require any special type of paint or sealant, and those that are made of clay tiles are highly durable in their natural state. While tiles can be painted to your color preference, this is not required as a finishing product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also be worried that certain types of tiles tend to weather poorly and cause cracking or crumbling. However, many of today’s tiles are made to last two decades or more and may only need replacing after a serious storm or if they become damaged in high winds. Many tiles that are manufactured today are also made to repel water, preventing them from becoming porous and retaining moisture. As a result, the tiles last longer instead of crumbling from water damage. <br>\nThe more you understand your roof and what may help it last longer, the more peace of mind and confidence you will have about it. Before you have a roof installed or maintained by a professional, consider all of your options carefully and know the facts, not the folly, about roofing.</p>\n",

      "title": "what is Home Loan Mortgage Rate ?",
      "content": "<p>A <strong>mortgage Home loan</strong> consists of principal and interest. The amount of money borrowed to buy your home is called Principal. The amount paid by the borrower under certain privileges to the lender, usually over 30 years, is the Interest. When the mortgage pays by the borrower each month, some amount goes to paying the principal and some to interest. The owner&#8217;s financial interest in a property is Equity. It is the difference between amount still owed on the mortgage loan and the property&#8217;s fair market value. Selecting the right home loan mortgage rate is central to the home buying process–that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to understand your options. You&#8217;ll need to consider two things at the outset: which loan type best meets your home buying needs, and which loan term offers the ideal repayment schedule.</p>\n<p>Most home loans fall into one of two general categories: <strong>fixed-rate mortgages</strong> and <strong>adjustable-rate mortgages</strong>. You&#8217;ll also encounter other basic loan types such as government loans and flexible credit solutions programs. For the buyer, this is more secure and popular who is looking first time for home mortgage loans. No change in monthly principal and interest payments regardless of fluctuations in interest rates more stability may give you &#8220;peace-of-mind&#8221;</p>\n<p>The HPA also have disclosure provisions for Home Loan Mortgage Rate that closed before July 29, 1999.In addition, the HPA includes provisions for borrower-requested cancellation and automatic termination of PMI.Once your loan is approved, FHA will ensure the loan and pay the lender if you default on mortgage. Because by this insurance the lender protects you, the lender on your loan give you better terms. With FHA mortgage insurance, you can use gift from your relatives or other local organization, or a government agency for the down payment and closing costs under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p><b class=\"title\"> Fixed term borrowing </b></p>\n<p>These types of loan are usually arranged through banks, building societies and credit institutions. The shorter the term of the loan, the higher the monthly repayments. The main type of personal loans are:</p>\n<p><strong>Unsecured Loans (Flat Rate)</strong> &#8211; The personal loan are on an average charged at a typical flat-rate of interest of 12-13%, although by checking best-buy tables in national newspapers, you may be able to find loans under 10%. Note, however, that loan companies check your credit rating at agencies such as Equifax, which may result in you being rejected if you have not had a good repayment record with former loans and credit cards. A five-year loan of £7,500, would cost approximately £175 per month.</p>\n<p><strong>Unsecured Loans (Variable Rate)</strong> &#8211; It is up to the borrower to decide whether to go for a fixed interest rate or the fluctuating variable rate. Often the borrowers opt for a variable rate sue to the expectation of falling interest rates. sometimes it is appropriate to opt for a variable rate. Generally taking the above example, but with a rate of 2% over base rate, the monthly cost would be around £150.</p>\n<p><strong>Secured Loan</strong> &#8211; These usually offer a lower interest rate than an unsecured loan, however, the loan is secured by way of a second charge on your property. A typical five-year secured loan of £7,500 at 6.85% (APR 7%) would cost £148 per month. Again, this is a variable rate. Generally a secured loan can be taken out over a longer period than an unsecured loan which will reduce the monthly outlay. Usually you will not have to pay a fee for personal borrowing, as all costs are built into the loan.</p>\n",

      "title": "HOW TO GET OUT OF A SELF-MANAGED SUPERANNUATION FUND",
      "content": "\n<p>You have started your own self-managed superannuation fund, but suddenly you aren’t sure if this was the right thing. How do you get out of this type of fund? This is the one question that many people have. They think that managing SMSF is easy and then they realize it was as easy as what they have thought. Now, they need to get out of this fund, and how do you really get to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>THE REASONS WHY YOU CAN’T CONTINUE WITH THE SMSF</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons why people can’t continue with their SMSF, and they need to get out if it as soon as possible. Most of the time you didn’t realize how much work it is to manage it yourself, and you don’t have the time anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also might not understand all the rules and regulations, and therefore you are making huge mistakes and you want to quit before you lose any more money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>NOTIFYING THE OTA</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You realized that you can’t do the self-managed superannuation fund anymore and you need to quit. The first thing that you should do is to notify the OTA within 28 days. It is important to make sure that you don’t notify them later than the 28 days. You can get some penalties for not notifying them of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also make sure that you know what the reason is for not continuing with the SMSF. This is because the OTA might ask why you are considering quitting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>MAKE SURE THAT THE FUND HAS NO ASSETS LEFT</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> You can’t get out of your SMSF if there are still assets left in the fund. You need to make sure that all the assets are withdrawn from the account and that there isn’t any property left in the name of the fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can rename the property or you can sell it to other SMSF people. The money can be transferred to another account that isn’t associated with the SMSF account. If you are leaving any assets in the fund, you might lose that money, or you might even not get too close the fund completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>GETTING A FINAL AUDIT</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> The last thing that you need to do, is to get a final audit of the self-managed superannuation fund. Without your last audit, you will not be able to close that book finally. This might be a daunting task to get a final audit and to make sure that everything is under control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you have done your last audit, you are done with your SMSF, and you can go on normally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SMSF can be really beneficial if you know how to do it correctly. However, there are some people that are not getting it right and that want to get out of this fund. This is possible, but it might be a longer process than what you have hoped for. With all these steps done, you will know for sure that you are done with the SMSF and that you can now use brokers for your investments again.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Paypal, owned by eBay is a great way of sending payments for eBay items or any items bought over the internet. Within minutes, you can send payments across the world. However, Paypal also has it’s fair share of critics and members who disagree with their policies and agreements, especially when a decision goes against the complaining member or they lose out to online fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using paypal, you can choose to pay for your item or service in a number of ways. The most popular method is by using any balance you have within your paypal account. This is built up, by other members sending you payment for eBay or other items. Alternatively, once you have registered your bank account and any debit or credit cards with paypal you can choose to pay for items using these options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The safest way for members to pay for items with Paypal, is by registering a credit card and funding all payments though this. Because, paying though credit card normally offers an extra level of protection should things go wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most countries, credit card companies are partially or full liable should things go wrong with a transaction and will actively get involved to resolve any issues or do a complete chargeback, placing the funds back on your account. Even if you enter into a dispute with paypal and lose, you can still get your credit card company involved to dispute any transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, paypal doesn’t make it easy for you to fund a payment using a credit card if you already have a balance in the account. Payments are normally funded out of the paypal balance first, and then either from a backup source (bank account or credit card) if the funds are not enough to pay for the complete purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To pay for an entire purchase, via your credit card you need to clear any balance. You can do this by sending the payment to a non existing email address, or to an email address you own but is not registered with paypal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as you do this your balance will be empty, &amp; you can now choose a funding option such as credit card. In the meantime, paypal will have sent an email to the non existing or alterative email address telling them of they have a payment waiting and how to open a paypal account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now your payment is complete, all you need to do is log back into your paypal account, find the transaction to the non existing email address and click on cancel. Your payment will be reversed back into your account, because it will have gone unclaimed.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>While it is undoubtedly very convenient to swipe your credit card when you are travelling overseas, it might be an eye-opener to know that you may be paying additional costs and fees every time you do so. Consider these statistics –</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Banks earn £500 million from overseas credit card usage.</li><li> According the Office of National Statistics, Britons spend more than £30 billion in foreign countries; of this, more than half is spent with credit cards.</li><li> Almost 70% of credit cards users are unaware that their credit card company levies additional surcharges and fees when they make card purchases during foreign jaunts.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were previously unaware of these charges, read on to find out the specific costs you could incur when you swipe your cards on non-UK soil.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Fees for Swiping your Card</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When using your card abroad, you may have to pay up to 2.75% of every single purchase you make as an exchange rate loading or foreign usage fee. This means if you have bought goods worth £1000 on your credit card, you may have actually paid £1027.50 for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Fees for Cash Withdrawal</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need cash whilst travelling abroad, you should try and avoid making withdrawals on your credit card as you may be subject to even further charges. Firstly, you may have to pay local cash withdrawal fees of approximately 1.5%. Secondly, you may also need to pay additional fees for withdrawing cash overseas. You may also be charged interest on the amount of cash you withdraw. This means that potentially for every £1,000 you take as cash you may end up paying £47.50 for the privilege (the equivalent of an interest rate of 4.75%)</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Currency Conversion</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Here you pay a bit of money, even though there are 2 ways in which currency is converted to sterling. In the older system, when you make credit card purchases abroad you pay in local currency. Visa or MasterCard then convert the purchase price to pounds when you reach home, and you pay the amount in sterling. Since the exchange rate fluctuates, you may either find yourself paying up more, or less than the day you made the purchases. In the new Dynamic Currency Conversion or DCC, the local payment vendor will inform you of the pounds sterling equivalent at the purchase point. However, although the exchange rate offered is normally quite poor, this method does help you to budget during your holiday as you are aware of the exact amount charged to your card.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that not all credit card providers charge you the same rate. If you are a savvy user, you should either be able to negotiate your card company into proving you with a more reasonable foreign usage rate or simply select a card that levies the lowest fees. This is well worth doing as by investigating possible credit card charges before you get on the plane, you may save up to 5% of your holiday costs.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<h4>Thirty-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has a constant interest rate and monthly payments that never change. This may be a good choice if you plan to stay in your home for seven years or longer. If you plan to move within seven years, then adjustable-rate loans are usually cheaper. As a rule of thumb, it may be harder to qualify for fixed-rate loans than for adjustable rate loans. When interest rates are low, fixed-rate loans are generally not that much more expensive than adjustable-rate mortgages and may be a better deal in the long run, because you can lock in the rate for the life of your loan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Fifteen-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> This loan is fully amortized over a 15-year period and features constant monthly payments. It offers all the advantages of the 30-year loan, plus a lower interest rate—and you&#8217;ll own your home twice as fast. The disadvantage is that, with a 15-year loan, you commit to a higher monthly payment. Many borrowers opt for a 30-year fixed-rate loan and voluntarily make larger payments that will pay off their loan in 15 years. This approach is often safer than committing to a higher monthly payment, since the difference in interest rates isn&#8217;t that great.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Hybrid ARM (3/1 ARM, 5/1 ARM, 7/1 ARM)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> These increasingly popular ARMS—also called 3/1, 5/1 or 7/1—can offer the best of both worlds: lower interest rates (like ARMs) and a fixed payment for a longer period of time than most adjustable rate loans. For example, a &#8220;5/1 loan&#8221; has a fixed monthly payment and interest for the first five years and then turns into a traditional adjustable-rate loan, based on then-current rates for the remaining 25 years. It&#8217;s a good choice for people who expect to move (or refinance) before or shortly after the adjustment occurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> When it comes to ARMs there&#8217;s a basic rule to remember…the longer you ask the lender to charge you a specific rate, the more expensive the loan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2/1 Buy Down Mortgage</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> The 2/1 Buy-Down Mortgage allows the borrower to qualify at below market rates so they can borrow more. The initial starting interest rate increases by 1% at the end of the first year and adjusts again by another 1% at the end of the second year. It then remains at a fixed interest rate for the remainder of the loan term. Borrowers often refinance at the end of the second year to obtain the best long-term rates. However, keeping the loan in place even for three full years or more will keep their average interest rate in line with the original market conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Annual ARM</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This loan has a rate that is recalculated once a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Monthly ARM</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With this loan, the interest rate is recalculated every month. Compared to other options, the rate is usually lower on this ARM because the lender is only committing to a rate for a month at a time, so his vulnerability is significantly reduced.</p>\n",

      "title": "Basic Principles of Student Insurance",
      "content": "\n<p>Insurance is simply defined as the equitable transfer of risk of loss from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium. The concept of Insurance was adopted  to share risk among groups of people, this way the chances of loss is greatly reduced in any business venture. In this article we are going to take a look at the basic principles of insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Principle of Nature of contract.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Nature of contract is a fundamental principle of insurance contract. An insurance contract comes into existence when one party makes an offer or proposal of a contract and the other party accepts the proposal. A contract should be simple to be a valid contract. The person entering into a contract should enter with his free consent.<br>\nAlso Read: Types Of SCHOLARSHIPS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Principal of Utmost Good Faith.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Under this insurance contract both the parties should have faith over each other. As a client it is the duty of the insured to disclose all the facts to the insurance company. Any fraud or misrepresentation of facts can result into cancellation of the contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Principle of Insurable Interest.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Under this principle of insurance, the insured must have interest in the subject matter of the insurance. Absence of insurance makes the contract null and void. If there is no insurable interest, an insurance company will not issue a policy.<br>\nAn insurable interest must exist at the time of the purchase of the insurance. For example, a creditor has an insurable interest in the life of a debtor, A person is considered to have an unlimited interest in the life of their spouse etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Principle of Indemnity.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Indemnity means security or compensation against loss or damage. The principle of indemnity is such principle of insurance stating that an insured may not be compensated by the insurance company in an amount exceeding the insured’s economic loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In type of insurance the insured would be compensation with the amount equivalent to the actual loss and not the amount exceeding the loss. The purpose of this principle is to set back the insured to the same financial position that existed before the loss or damage occurred.<br>\nMust Read: How To Apply For SCHOLARSHIPS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Principal Of Subrogation.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The principle of subrogation helps the insured party to claim the amount from the third party responsible for the loss. It allows the insurer to make use of legal methods in recovering the amount of loss. For instance, if you get injured in a road accident, due to reckless driving of a third party, the insurance company will compensate your loss and will also sue the third party to recover the money paid as claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Principle Of Double Insurance Loss Minimization.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Double insurance denotes insurance of same subject matter with two different companies or with the same company under two different policies. Insurance is possible in case of indemnity contract like fire, marine and property insurance.<br>\nDouble insurance policy is adopted where the financial position of the insurer is doubtful. The insured cannot recover more than the actual loss and cannot claim the whole amount from both the insurers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Principle Of Proximate Cause or Causa Proxima.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The principle of Proximate cause basically means the ‘nearest cause’ or ‘direct cause’. This principle is applicable when the loss is the result of two or more causes. The proximate cause means; the most dominant and most effective cause of loss is considered. This principle is applicable when there are series of causes of damage or loss.</p>\n",

What exactly is a Credit Report? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Aritcle Keyword Summary: Credit Reports, Free Online Credit Reports, Equifax Credit Report, Trans Union Credit Report, Experian Credit Report, Credit Report Dispute </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Credit Rating is a scientific calculation that uses statistical models to assess an individual&#8217;s credit worthiness based on his or her credit history and current credit accounts. Credit scoring was first developed in the 1950s, but has become more widely used over the last 20 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In the early 80’s the three major credit reporting bureaus, Experian, Equifax and Trans Union all worked in conjunction with the Fair Isaac Co. to develop scoring models that allow each credit bureau to offer a score based solely on the contents of the credit bureau&#8217;s data about an individual. Most creditors use these credit scoring systems to evaluate an individual before extending credit, especially home mortgage companies. Creditors can order credit reports from any or all of the 3 credit reporting bureaus to check your credit score.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Today with advancements in the Internet, you can also order a copy of your credit report with relative ease. Credit reports usually come with a credit report analysis as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Depending on which credit reporting bureau you get your report from, your scores may vary slightly. Each credit reporting bureau has a slightly different way of calculating your score but the scoring models have been normalized so that the scores are almost equivalent to each other. The scoring system is built on a scale from <strong>375 points to 900 points</strong>. A score of 700 represents a good score.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It is a good idea to check you credit report every so often. It is not uncommon or impossible for a credit report to have a mistake that is affecting your credit in a negative manner. If you feel there is a mistake on your credit report you can dispute the credit information. </span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Credit Report Dispute</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> To dispute inaccurate information on your Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion credit report, write to the bureau that supplied the information.

One that CLOSES?. Not necessarily. We all know that not all leads will close. In fact if I was able to close between 8% and 14% of the ML&#8217;s I purchase on the internet, I would be happy. I consider a ML to be a high quality lead if it meets the following criteria:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>-The Lead is Fresh</strong><br />\nIt is critical to find out how quickly a ML generation broker turns the lead around and delivers it to you. Best case scenario, the lead is delivered instantly (real-time mortgage leads) and it is an exclusive mortgage lead (only delivered to you). At a minimum you want to make sure it is delivered in less than 48 hours. Otherwise, the lead is less valuable and should not be sold at the same premium as a real-time mortgage lead. The more time that passes from the time the user requested information, the less your chances of closing the sale to this lead. I&#8217;ve seen many cases where users deny even requesting information. The quicker you contact them, the less likely this is to happen. Hit while the iron is hot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>-The Lead is Accurate</strong><br />\nOne of the biggest challenges ML generation companies face is obtaining accurate data from users. No matter what type of technology a </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">ML</span></span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> company claims to have, no company can completely stop users from entering inaccurate data. Companies will claim to have all sorts software to ensure more accurate data.<br />\nA recent example of technology to improve data accuracy is telephone number/location verification. Companies use software to make sure the area code in the phone number matches the state. This is a nice feature because chances are if a user is going to enter a bogus phone number they will not enter the correct area code. What you must do is evaluate </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">ML</span></span><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> generation companies and decide who has the best solution to fit your needs. Also, consider telemarketing </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">ML</span></span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>-The Lead is a True Lead</strong><br />\nWhat do I mean by this? I consider a true lead to be a lead that was actually generated by someone that is truly interested in obtaining a mortgage. You have to be careful that the lead is not ‘Incentivized’. For those of you that aren’t familiar with this new term I will explain. Many websites today offer users incentives to fill out forms. In exchange for filling out these forms users are given points towards the purchase of merchandise or even money. Make sure you stay away from companies that have anything to do with incentivized leads. These are worthless !!!</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span><a id=\"Internet_Mortgage_Lead\" name=\"Internet_Mortgage_Lead\"></a></span></span><span>What you should expect from an Internet ML?</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">This is simple. Don’t set your expectations to high. Like I said earlier it would be great to close at a rate 8% &#8211; 14%. Remember that you are buying leads, not sales. Expect accurate data 80% of the time and try to close at least 8% of these leads and you should be doing very well for yourself.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span><a id=\"Exclusive_Internet_Mortgage_Lead\" name=\"Exclusive_Internet_Mortgage_Lead\"></a></span></span><span>Closing the sell to your Internet MLs</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Again, this is a simple concept. The quicker you contact the lead, the better the chance of closing the sale. The first thing you should do is make contact. Once you have made contact with the lead ask questions and find out what they are looking for. After this initial contact you can follow up with a quote and answers to their questions. Quick response, quick response, quick response !!!!</span></p>\n<h4><span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a id=\"Internet_Mortgage_Lead_Guide\" name=\"Internet_Mortgage_Lead_Guide\"></a></span>Questions to ask your ML Generation Company</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">These are the not so obvious but very important questions to ask.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>What is your lead return policy?</strong><br />\nIt is vital that you find this out before purchasing Internet <span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">ML</span>s. Bad leads are worthless to you and at aprox $30 each, this can get expensive quick. No batch of leads will be completely accurate, but you won’t to make sure that the percentage that is bad is not greater than 10% &#8211; 15%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Tip:</strong> Some companies say they will refund a maximum of 10%-15% of the total purchased for bad leads. Use this percentage as a negotiating point when purchasing leads.</span></p>\n<p>Also ask the company what makes a lead returnable. What makes the lead invalid? Different companies will have different policies on what constitutes a bad lead.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><br />\n<strong>How many times are your leads sold?</strong><br />\nWhen purchasing leads you must make sure that companies aren’t overselling the leads they generate. The best lead is an exclusive </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">ML</span></span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">, meaning you are the only person the lead was sold to. Exclusive </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">ML</span></span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">s are more expensive but you are ensured that you should be the only person receiving the lead.

      "title": "what is Private Equity Investment",
      "content": "<p>Private equity is capital made accessible to private companies or investors. The company will use these funds to develop new technologies or products, make acquisitions, fortify working capital, or strengthen their balance sheet.</p>\n<p>An investor’s choice in the risky world of private equity is somewhat limited unless they are willing to invest $250,000 or more. Most wealthy persons and institutional investors are attracted to private-equity investments such as family offices, university endowments, and pension plans. This investment money goes into allotments and funds high-risk ventures in their early stages and is a major player in the economy.</p>\n<p>Often, the money will go into new companies believed to have substantial growth potentials in industries such as biotechnology software, hardware, telecommunications, and healthcare. Private-equity firms such as Tamago Investments Limited try to add value to the companies they buy, with the goal of making them even more valuable. For example, they might bring in a new management team, add matching companies, assertively cut costs, and then sell the company for large profits.</p>\n<p>These companies received private-equity funding, without which they may not have grown into the recognized companies they are today</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FedEx</li>\n<li>Harrah’s Entertainment Inc.</li>\n<li>Intel</li>\n<li>A&amp;W Restaurants</li>\n<li>Network Solutions (the world’s largest domain name registrar)</li>\n<li>Cisco Systems</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Minimum Investment Typically Required</h3>\n<p>Private-equity investing is not readily available for the typical investor. Most private-equity firms look for investors that will commit to as much as $25 million and even though some firms have lowered their minimum to $250,000, for most people this is not feasible.</p>\n<h3>Fund of Funds</h3>\n<p>A fund of funds holds the shares of various private partnerships that invest in private equities. It delivers a method for firms to increase cost effectiveness and in so doing reduce their minimum investment prerequisite. This can also mean a larger diversification, since a fund of funds might invest in hundreds of companies embodying many different phases of venture capital and industry sectors; and because of its size and diversification, a fund of funds has the capability to offer less risk than one may encounter with a specific private-equity investment.</p>\n<p>The shortcoming of this is that there is an extra layer of payments that are paid to the fund of funds manager. With the minimum investment of between $100,000 to $5 million needed for investments, most mangers will not let someone participate who does not have a net worth of at least $1.5 million</p>\n<h3>Private-Equity ETF</h3>\n<p>Exchange-traded fund (ETF) can be purchased individually so there is no worry of a minimum requirement. ETF tracks the index of traded companies that invest in private equities, however, just as with a fund of funds, this will add other expenses that you may not have with a direct private- equity investment. You may also be charged a fee when you buy or sell these shares.</p>\n<h3>Special-Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC)</h3>\n<p>Investing in publicly traded shell companies is another investment option. Shell companies make private-equity investments in public companies that are undervalued. This means that the SPAC’s may only invest in one company, which does allow any diversification. They may be under pressure to meet an investment target and can take on investments without much attentiveness to issues in the company.</p>\n",

      "title": "Holiday Tips For Credit Card Safety",
      "content": "\n<p>Almost one-third of users experience credit card fraud and in 2010 close to 11 million adults experienced identity theft, with 43 percent of reported theft linked to credit card fraud. As of 2010, estimated showed that 11.1 million adults are victims of identity theft each year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are staggering numbers and are the reason that credit card safety is an ongoing necessity for all of us. During holiday season even greater vigilance is necessary for many obvious reasons. Most security actions fall into the common sense group, but with busy lives we often end up tasking without adding a good dose of forethought.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Following are my top ten list of easy, fast habits anyone can build to support credit/debit card security.</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Never write down your PIN number and make sure to cover the keypad when entering on any machine. For added secure, do not use a PIN number tied to personally identifiable information. A quick Google search with your name may shock you about your personal data floating around on the web.</li><li> Sign the back of your card upon receiving it and destroy old cards immediately. Scissor through the name line and account number. Scrap away the bar code with the scissor blade. Even better, use a home shredder to completely destroy cards.</li><li> Review receipts, both ATM and store, to make sure the figures are accurate.</li><li> Destroy receipts as soon as possible. I tear ATM receipts into small bits immediately upon verification. Credit receipts are matched to statements online and then shredded.</li><li> The only time to give card information over the phone is when you’ve made the call and know the vendor is reputable. Short of this, don’t use the phone for dispensing card information.</li><li> Avoid public computers and unsecured networks for all financial transactions, including account balance checks. Online purchases are fast, convenient and a major part of our shopping experiences. However, use only a private-secured connection. Look for the HTTPS//: and closed padlock icon in the address bar.</li><li> Never leave a card unattended. It belongs in your hand, wallet or purse. A teller should not take your card to a machine. If so, request to go with the clerk or have the machine brought to you. Unattended includes a card left in the car, hotel room or any place someone can easily access.</li><li> Check for skimmers when using ATMs, self-checkout lanes, and swipe pads. A stand-alone swipe pad attached by cable is a red flag for a skimmer.</li><li> The new RFID chip cards bring added security using a radio transmitter to send client data, but also need special caution by the user. RFID is easily susceptible to someone with a hand-held reader standing close enough to steal card information. Reportedly, some people have been able to steal card data with a cell phone app. Take added care by using Tyvek sleeves or RFID wallets that can block radio signals</li><li> Carry only a few cards or better yet one. People tend to have multiple cards, but should carry only those used – be selective.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Increased card use provides greater chance for credit fraud leading to a disappointing way to start the new year. Be on your guard through the holidays and use these tips when you use a credit card.</p>\n",

      "title": "Using Credit Cards Safely Online",
      "content": "\n<p>In recent years online shopping has become part of everyday life and competes head on with more traditional ways of shopping for everything from groceries through to travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the rise in online shopping there are often fears of personal information falling into the wrong hands and the risk of credit card fraud occurring. While everything carries a risk, shopping online should be relatively safe providing you follow these tips to keep your details in the right hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use well known websites: The Internet has matured to the point that many online companies such as Amazon have become household names. Also, big brands from the real world have moved online. Well known names are likely to use the latest online security measures and handle a large number of transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check company reputation with first time purchases: Sometimes you’re bound to want to buy something online from a company you have not purchased from before. If it’s your first time shopping with a company then check out the company before making purchases to be sure they have a good reputation. Prior to the internet you had to rely on people you know for recommendations but these days there are many consumer review websites where companies and products are rated and discussed. You can also check the Better Business Bureau for details on the company including known complaints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only use secure websites: Once your happy with the company you are purchasing from you need to ensure your credit card details are being processed using a secure connection. The most common form of secure encryption is known as Secure Sockets Layer or SSL for short. SSL encrypts data and breaks it up into small pieces so that the information can not be read by anyone wanting to intercept it. To check your purchase is using SSL or secure technology there are a few things to look out for in your Internet browser. Depending on your browser settings you may receive a message stating that you are entering a secure area. The secure area normally begins on the first page where you enter personal details. You can also look out for a padlock symbol in your browser symbolizing the page is secure. Most often the address bar in your browser will change from starting with http to https.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never send your credit card details through non-secure online methods such as via email. Such methods will offer little protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security Code: An increasing number of online stores now request a CVV or card verification number when making a purchase. The CVV code is the small code shown on the signature bar on the back of your card. Normally the last 3 digits of the code are required. This is to prevent someone who has managed to get your name; card number and expiration date from being able to make purchases using your card.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further security: Another security feature that credit card companies are using is to create another level of security by adding an additional password. An example of this is Verified by Visa or Mastercard Secure Code. This is an optional feature so only offers support with selected websites or payment processing systems. If you activate the code and shop on sites that carry the logo, the check out process will require the password you set up in order to authorize your purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phishing emails – don’t get hooked: Be aware of email scams designed to part you from your credit card information. Email scams that are designed to gather personal information such as passwords and credit card details are known as phishing emails. The idea is that thousands or hundreds of thousands are sent out in the hope of reeling in unsuspecting victims and getting them to part with confidential information. The emails appear to be from well known companies and can look quite convincing. However, legitimate companies including all banks will never send you an email with a link requesting your login, password or credit card details. If in doubt, type the web address of the company it relates to directly into the browser rather than following the email link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use a credit card with online fraud protection: Just in case all else fails it pays to know the policy for online fraud protection offered by your credit card company. Many credit card companies offer protection against purchases made without your consent and have special clauses to include online purchases. Credit cards tend to offer more protection than debit cards as they don’t directly remove funds from your own back account. If a transaction goes under investigation or proves to be fraudulent you may never end up out of pocket with a credit card providing your card issuer provides protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online shopping is certainly here to stay and online security continues to advance. There are arguments that shopping online can be safer than shopping over the phone or even in person as you never hand you card details over to another person. Just remember to follow these tips to help keep your online shopping safe and secure.</p>\n",

Since the American Home Mortgage rate not goes to up, the best thing for the homeowners is secure the best fixed rate mortgage they can find.</p>\n<p><strong>b. Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM)</strong><br />\nIn many ways an adjustable-rate mortgage differs from a fixed-rate mortgage in American Home Mortgage.

In both cases, payment of the loan is the amount required to pay off the mortgage in full over 30 years. The difference in both is that after a specified period, generally 5 or 7 years, the outstanding balance (the &#8220;balloon&#8221;) has to be repaid in full.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Every university student abroad needs insurance. It’s importance cannot be under-emphasized. Insurance takes care of every eventuality that might arise during your stay. Types of insurance  every student must have varies, in this article we will talk about some of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Health Insurance.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Younger people experience fewer medical problems. Probably because they have a stronger immune system, stronger metabolism, and overall stronger body than other age groups. Most likely, as a young person you probably haven’t had any serious ailment in years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are things  which stress resulting from university education can do to your body that affects its ability to stay healthy. some of them includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Poor Sleeping Habits.</li><li>Lack Of Properly Cooked Meals.</li><li>Drinking caffeinated beverages.</li><li>Inadequate Exercise.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Health insurance is very vital, personally i would say it is the most important of all, because Health is Wealth and good health is more important than money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Accommodation Insurance.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most university students live in rented apartments during the school year. It’s not important to pay for any repairs or upgrades in the rented apartment, so you might assume that you don’t need accomodation insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of insurance helps you take care of everything within the confines of your rented abode, for instance if you had a thief burgle into your apartment and carting away important valuables, your accomodation insurance will cater for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Homeowners’ Insurance.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every university student likes to live in a rented place. Some are wealthy  enough money to buy their own homes. This type of insurance covers everything inside and within the premises of your home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also protects the  structure and yard from damage or destruction. Homes cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and with this type of insurance you won’t have to pay for rebuilding in case of any mishaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Automobile Insurance.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Every student who owns a car requires  auto insurance for  protection  in case of  accidents. Even if you drive responsibly, someone else could crash into you. And if you accidentally damage someone’s car or property, you’ll need car insurance to protect you from whatever  expenses that might arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer walking or making use of public transportation, then  this kind of insurance is not ideal for you. Most university students find it very useful to own a car. It helps them travel to efficiently from place to place, and it gives them the flexibility to go home on weekends. Having a car gives you the privilege of not having  to ask anyone for rides to parties or grocery stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>. Insurance policies are like financial safety nets, they provide solutions in unpleasant and unexpected situations. It is very important for every student to have any or all of the four types of insurance talked about in this article.</p>\n",

      "title": "When is it Right to Refinance?",
      "content": "<p>With &#8220;everyone&#8221; talking about the historically low mortgage rates you are ready to decide if it &#8220;pays&#8221; to refinance. The &#8220;rule of thumb&#8221; supplied by mortgage companies is that if you can reduce your interest rate by 1% it is usually profitable. But there is more to it than that. Like how long are you planning on staying in the house? Realistically, the first thing you need to determine is what rates do you qualify for and what are the other costs (like points and closing costs).</p>\n<p>When refinancing it is common to roll the additional costs and fees back into the mortgage so there are no &#8220;out of pocket&#8221; costs. But this allows the Bank or other mortgage holder to charge you interest on these fees. At the current low interest rates and if you choose a short time period for your mortgage the additional interest will be relatively small. But even at these low rates, if you have a 30 year mortgage, interest will end up doubling the amount of fees over the 30 year life of the loan. Assume you took a 30 year, $115,000 First mortgage on a house 5 years ago. The interest rate at the time was 7.5% and your principal and interest payment was $765.10 per month. (If $765.10 sounds low to you, remember your &#8220;actual payment&#8221; may also include mortgage insurance, taxes and home owners insurance.) After paying $765.10 per month or $9181.20/year for 5 years you have spent a total of $45,906. Plus, you still owe about $108,000 on your $115,000 mortgage and you still have 25 more years to go! Not much of your payment is going toward principal! So the sooner you can get out from under the better. Recently interest rates have fallen to around 5% so you consider refinancing. Assuming Closing Costs, fees and expenses are about $3,000. you will have to &#8220;borrow&#8221; $111,000. to pay off your $108,000. loan (or come up with the $3,000.) from savings. If you decide to refinance the additional costs for another 30 years&#8230; your loan amount would be $111,000. and you would be almost back to where you started 5 years ago&#8230; but your payment would drop to $595.87 for a monthly savings of $169.23 Although it might be nice to have an additional $169.23 to spend each month, the question is what will you do with the money? Go out to eat more, buy more toys? Invest it in your retirement fund? Or just &#8220;blow it&#8221;? If you just &#8220;blow it&#8221;&#8230; all you have accomplished is that you are in debt to the bank for an additional 5 years. Not a happy prospect&#8230; What if you set the mortgage term to 25 years? In that case, your payment would be $648.89 saving you $116.21 per month. So for an additional $53.02 per month your mortgage term remained the same. Personally, I think that is a better solution. At least you aren&#8217;t pushing your retirement out an additional 5 years while you continue paying your mortgage. Remember, the original question was&#8230; Is it worth it to refinance and pay the additional $3000. or just keep paying on the old mortgage? Keep in mind, as soon as you sign the papers the equity you have in your house drops by $3000! Assuming you chose the 25 year mortgage (with the $116.21/mo savings) it will take you 25.8 months to break even ($3000/$116.21) because at that point you will have saved the $3000. it cost you to refinance. So if you intend to stay in your house 3 or more years it would pay for you to refinance. But what if you took it one step further? What if you kept your payment the same and reduced the term of your mortgage as far as possible? A $111,000 mortgage at 5% with a payment of about $765 would require a term of 223 months or about 18.5 years. Assuming you could get an 18.5 year mortgage and you intended to stay in your house that long, this would be an excellent move! You have drastically reduced the amount of money you will pay the bank over the life of the mortgage and you are free and clear 6.5 years earlier! Even if you move sooner, your equity will be building faster so you will have more money when you sell. Unfortunately, lenders do not usually let you choose an odd term length like 18.5 years , so you would have to choose either a 20 year term with a payment of $732.55 which would still save you about $30/month but also knock 5 years off your loan (and build equity somewhat faster). Or you could choose a 15 year term with a payment of $877.78 which would actually cost you about $110/month more than what you are currently paying but would knock a full 10 years off your mortgage. If your income has risen since you got your initial mortgage and you could swing it&#8230; it would be money well spent. For those with higher incomes who have difficulty saving, this is a great idea because it actually forces you to save a little bit more each month and once you get used to it, you won&#8217;t even miss it. Perhaps you can remove the mortgage insurance off your mortgage. On the original loan, you might have to pay it for the first 10 years, so you would still have to pay it for 5 more years. But&#8230; if you have made improvements to the home&#8230; or property values have increased dramatically in your neighborhood&#8230; you might be able to get the new loan without the mortgage insurance. If you can, you will save an additional $100/month! With that savings you can move to the 15 year mortgage without mortgage insurance for the same amount that you are currently paying for a 30 year mortgage with mortgage insurance. Not bad eh? Whack 15 years off your mortgage just like that! Another way to reduce the monthly payment is to reduce the amount you borrow. If you could come up with the additional $3000 in closing costs from savings, your monthly payment on a 15 year mortgage would drop from $877.78 to $854.06 .. or only about $89. per month more than what you are currently paying. Is it worth $89/month to knock another 5 years off your mortgage? That depends on your personal circumstances! If your budget is already stretched to the limit, or it will put you at risk if you lose your job, NO. But if you can find a way to come up with $3.00 per day, (perhaps by giving up cigarettes, or skipping a trip to the vending machine or to McDonalds) it will save you thousands over the life of your mortgage!</p>\n",

Credit scoring was first developed in the 1950s, but has become more widely used over the last 20 years. In the early 80’s the three major credit reporting bureaus, Experian, Equifax and Trans Union all worked in conjunction with the Fair Isaac Co. to develop scoring models that allow each credit bureau to offer a score based solely on the contents of the credit bureau&#8217;s data about an individual. Most creditors use these credit scoring systems to evaluate an individual before extending credit, especially home mortgage companies. Creditors can order credit reports from any or all of the 3 credit reporting bureaus to check your credit score. Today with advancements in the Internet, you can also order a copy of your credit report with relative ease. Credit reports usually come with a credit report analysis as well. Depending on which bureau you get your report from, your scores may vary slightly. Each bureau has a slightly different way of calculating your score but the scoring models have been normalized so that the scores are almost equivalent to each other. The scoring system is built on a scale from 375 points to 900 points. A score of 700 represents a good score. It is a good idea to check you credit report every so often. It is not uncommon or impossible for human errors affecting your credit in a negative manner. If you feel there is a mistake you can dispute the credit information.</p>\n<p>For dispute information contact:</p>\n<p>National Consumer Relations<br />\nEquifax Canada Inc.<br />\nBox 190<br />\nStation Jean-Talon<br />\nMontreal, Quebec<br />\nH1S 2Z2<br />\nFacsimile: (514) 355-8502</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Unless you have perfect credit, or you plan to purchase an investment property that has a lot of equity in it, an investment property loan may be hard to obtain. Investment properties can be single family homes, duplexes, apartment buildings, commercial buildings, and any other property that you plan to rent out or lease to tenants on a month to month basis. You do not live in the property yourself. You use the dwelling to create a steady source of income, hence the term investment. At first, the rental income is used to make or offset the monthly payment on the property loan. Then, once the loan is repaid, the rental income can be used for any purpose, such as saving for retirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are buying a property that is worth much more than the loan amount you are requesting, you may not have a problem getting an investment property loan. This happens when you are interested in a property that is being sold at a tax sale or being foreclosed on. If there isn’t any equity in the property, you probably won’t have any trouble getting an investment property loan, providing you have a down payment of at least twenty percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a property is not worth the amount of money you are requesting, regardless of whether you have a down payment or not, that is when you will have trouble getting an investment property loan. Lenders look at property values when determining the maximum amount of money that they will loan to you. They do not take into consideration things like how much the property will be valued at after you make renovations. When you want to buy a property and make renovations, you may have to rely on a hard money loan. Rather than borrowing from traditional lenders, you may have to borrow from private investors. They are more willing than traditional lenders to look at the potential that the property has</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<h4>2/1 Buy Down Mortgage</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> The 2/1 Buy Down Mortgage allows the borrower to qualify at below market rates so they can borrow more. The initial starting interest rate increases by 1% at the end of the first year and adjusts again by another 1% at the end of the second year. It then remains at a fixed interest rate for the remainder of the loan term. Borrowers often refinance at the end of the second year to obtain the best long term rates; however, even keeping the loan in place for three full years or more will keep their average interest rate in line with the original market conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Acceleration Clause</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> Provision in a mortgage that allows the lender to demand payment of the entire principal balance if a monthly payment is missed or some other default occurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Additional Principal Payment</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> A way to reduce the remaining balance on the loan by paying more than the scheduled principal amount due.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> A mortgage with an interest rate that changes during the life of the loan according to movements in an index rate.

For example, 360 months is the amortization term for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> The cost of credit, expressed as a yearly rate including interest, mortgage insurance, and loan origination fees. This allows the buyer to compare loans, however APR should not be confused with the actual note rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Appraisal</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> A written analysis prepared by a qualified appraiser and estimating the value of a property.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Appraised Value</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> An opinion of a property&#8217;s fair market value, based on an appraiser&#8217;s knowledge, experience, and analysis of the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Asset</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> Anything owned of monetary value including real property, personal property, and enforceable claims against others (including bank accounts, stocks, mutual funds, etc.).</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Assignment</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> The transfer of a mortgage from one person to another.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Assumability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> An assumable mortgage can be transferred from the seller to the new buyer. Generally requires a credit review of the new borrower and lenders may charge a fee for the assumption. If a mortgage contains a due-on-sale clause, it may not be assumed by a new buyer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Assumption Fee</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> The fee paid to a lender (usually by the purchaser of real property) when an assumption takes place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Balance Sheet</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> A financial statement that shows assets, liabilities, and net worth as of a specific date.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Balloon Mortgage</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> A mortgage with level monthly payments that amortizes over a stated term but also requires that a lump sum payment be paid at the end of an earlier specified term.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Balloon Payment</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> The final lump sum paid at the maturity date of a balloon mortgage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Before-tax Income</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> Income before taxes are deducted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Biweekly Payment Mortgage</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> A plan to reduce the debt every two weeks (instead of the standard monthly payment schedule). The 26 (or possibly 27) biweekly payments are each equal to one-half of the monthly payment required if the loan were a standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.

Buydowns can occur in both fixed and adjustable rate mortgages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cap<br>\nLimits how much the interest rate or the monthly payment can increase, either at each adjustment or during the life of the mortgage. Payment caps don&#8217;t limit the amount of interest the lender is earning and may cause negative amortization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certificate of Eligibility<br>\nA document issued by the federal government certifying a veteran’s eligibility for a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mortgage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certificate of Reasonable Value (CRV)<br>\nA document issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that establishes the maximum value and loan amount for a VA mortgage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Change Frequency<br>\nThe frequency (in months) of payment and/or interest rate changes in an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closing<br>\nA meeting held to finalize the sale of a property.

Usually conversion is allowed at the end of the first adjustment period. The conversion feature may cost extra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit Report<br>\nA report detailing an individual&#8217;s credit history that is prepared by a credit bureau and used by a lender to determine a loan applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit Risk Score<br>\nA credit score measures a consumer&#8217;s credit risk relative to the rest of the U.S. population, based on the individual&#8217;s credit usage history. The credit score most widely used by lenders is the FICO® score, developed by Fair, Issac and Company. This 3-digit number, ranging from 300 to 850, is calculated by a mathematical equation that evaluates many types of information that are on your credit report. Higher FICO® scores represents lower credit risks, which typically equate to better loan terms. In general, credit scores are critical in the mortgage loan underwriting process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deed of Trust<br>\nThe document used in some states instead of a mortgage.

For example, a &#8220;5/1 loan&#8221; has a fixed monthly payment and interest for the first five years and then turns into a traditional adjustable rate loan, based on then-current rates for the remaining 25 years. It&#8217;s a good choice for people who expect to move or refinance, before or shortly after, the adjustment occurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Index<br>\nThe index is the measure of interest rate changes a lender uses to decide the amount an interest rate on an ARM will change over time.The index is generally a published number or percentage, such as the average interest rate or yield on Treasury bills. Some index rates tend to be higher than others and some more volatile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initial Interest Rate<br>\nThis refers to the original interest rate of the mortgage at the time of closing.

Each month&#8217;s rent payment consists of principal, interest, taxes and insurance (PITI) payments on the first mortgage plus an extra amount that accumulates in a savings account for a downpayment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liabilities<br>\nA person&#8217;s financial obligations. Liabilities include long-term and short-term debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifetime Payment Cap<br>\nFor an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), a limit on the amount that payments can increase or decrease over the life of the mortgage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifetime Rate Cap<br>\nFor an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), a limit on the amount that the interest rate can increase or decrease over the life of the loan. See cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Line of Credit<br>\nAn agreement by a commercial bank or other financial institution to extend credit up to a certain amount for a certain time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquid Asset<br>\nA cash asset or an asset that is easily converted into cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loan<br>\nA sum of borrowed money (principal) that is generally repaid with interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loan-to-Value (LTV) Percentage<br>\nThe relationship between the principal balance of the mortgage and the appraised value (or sales price if it is lower) of the property. For example, a $100,000 home with an $80,000 mortgage has an LTV of 80 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lock-In Period<br>\nThe guarantee of an interest rate for a specified period of time by a lender, including loan term and points, if any, to be paid at closing. Short term locks (under 21 days), are usually available after lender loan approval only. However, many lenders may permit a borrower to lock a loan for 30 days or more prior to submission of the loan application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Margin<br>\nThe number of percentage points the lender adds to the index rate to calculate the ARM interest rate at each adjustment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maturity<br>\nThe date on which the principal balance of a loan becomes due and payable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monthly Fixed Installment<br>\nThat portion of the total monthly payment that is applied toward principal and interest. When a mortgage negatively amortizes, the monthly fixed installment does not include any amount for principal reduction and doesn&#8217;t cover all of the interest. The loan balance therefore increases instead of decreasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mortgage<br>\nA legal document that pledges a property to the lender as security for payment of a debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mortgage Banker<br>\nA company that originates mortgages exclusively for resale in the secondary mortgage market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mortgage Broker<br>\nAn individual or company that brings borrowers and lenders together for the purpose of loan origination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mortgage Insurance<br>\nA contract that insures the lender against loss caused by a mortgagor&#8217;s default on a government mortgage or conventional mortgage.

Negative amortization occurs when the monthly payments do not cover all of the interest cost. The interest cost that isn&#8217;t covered is added to the unpaid principal balance. This means that even after making many payments, you could owe more than you did at the beginning of the loan. Negative amortization can occur when an ARM has a payment cap that results in monthly payments not high enough to cover the interest due.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Net Worth<br>\nThe value of all of a person&#8217;s assets, including cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Non Liquid Asset<br>\nAn asset that cannot easily be converted into cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note<br>\nA legal document that obligates a borrower to repay a mortgage loan at a stated interest rate during a specified period of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Origination Fee<br>\nA fee paid to a lender for processing a loan application.

      "title": "PURCHASE PROPERTY USING YOUR SUPERANNUATION – 6 WAYS TO MAKE IT WORK",
      "content": "\n<p>People use their self managed superannuation fund all the time to purchase property. This can truly be a useful way to invest and it certainly opens the door to potential too. However, a lot of people aren’t sure how this can work, if at all! It’s easy to see why it looks very complicated and difficult in making superannuation funds work but it can be far easier if you think about it. Want to know ways in which you can make purchasing simple? Read on to find out more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>A JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENT</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> When you look into a joint venture investment it means at least two parties must come to agreement over a property. This can often be highly sought after as it means even if one or two parties don’t have sufficient funds, another party can be brought in to help complete the deal. It’s something which a lot of people are looking into with their self managed superannuation funds. You really can get a lot of help from this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>TENANTS IN COMMON CLAUSE</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> With tenants in common clause it essentially means two or more parties will be involved in owning a percent of the property. For instance, an individual can own thirty five percent of the property with the super fund owning the remaining fixed percent of the property. It could be a smaller or larger percentage depending on the property. The fund cannot be used to purchase the other percent of the property unless it’s a business property. A self managed super fund cannot be used to buy property from someone the fund’s executors know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A UNIT TRUST DEAL<br>\nIn order to get a unit trust for property, there must be two parties at least, who will buy a percentage (fixed) of the property up for sale. These deals really have become highly sought after as they can offer so much to those who want to invest. It’s a good option for most people and it’s not too difficult to work with either.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>A DIRECT PURCHASE</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> In order to opt for a direct purchase route the fund must have sufficient funds to purchase one hundred percent of the home. If you are able to look at this method, it’s great because it means you’ve bought the home outright and it’s certainly a good investment too. Anyone who wants to invest in property and has self managed superannuation funds can benefit from direct purchasing. However, the amount you have within the fund can limit the type of property you’re able to purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>AN INSTALMENT WARRANT</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> These types of arrangement can seem quite confusing so let’s make it as simple as possible. If you were to choose this route there will be a trust that owns the title to the property while you have a recourse loan. The fund is the one who receive any and all income resulting from income from the property. However, the funds are also responsible for any expenses which might come as a result of the purchase such as repayments. After the loan has been repaid in full, the title can be then transferred to the fund. To find out more, check out smsfselfmanagedsuperfund.com.au.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>A PRE-99 UNIT TRUST DEAL</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> For most, a pre-99 unit trust deal is not an option open to them. Why? Well, because very few investors have the ability to structure their investment in the manner in which this uses. However, that doesn’t mean to say this can’t be something that works for you but you certainly have to be careful. You really need to research this topic closely if you wanted to look into it further. Self managed superannuation funds can be useful but you need to be wary as to how you use the money from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>MAKE IT WORK</h4>\n\n\n\n<p> When you have a SMSF and you want to make it work, you have to think very carefully and sensibly over how you approach your investments. It’s not only important to ensure the investments are good for your overall investment portfolio but that you also have the ability to earn back from the investment. You have to be very careful when it comes to investing but if you can be smart about it, you can hopefully see some level of success. Use your self managed superannuation fund with caution.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>For those who intend to enter the world of <strong>Forex trading</strong>, our Money and Finance blog presents detailed information about what Forex trading is, how it works and what are the main points that you must keep in mind in order to succeed in this business.</p>\n<p>The Forex trading market, more precisely the <strong>Foreign Exchange Trading</strong> market, is one of the largest markets in the world, with trades amounting to more than 3 trillion US dollars every day. In most of cases, foreign exchange trading, which deals with the world’s many currencies, has a speculative character, rather than representing governments’ or big companies’ fundamental needs. To be speculative means assumption of unusual business risk in hopes of obtaining commensurate gain by buying or selling currencies.</p>\n<p>In other words, <strong>Forex trading </strong>is the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling of another. Currencies’ exchange rates are never stable and are traded in pairs, for example Euro/USD. The currency combination used in the trade is called a cross. Among all the traded currencies there are crosses which are called “majors”, like Euro/USD, USD/Japanese yen, USD/CHF and GBP/USD.</p>\n<p>For <strong>trading currency</strong> you must also be aware who are the participants of this market to be able to compete with them. Let me inform you that the Forex market is also known as “Interbank”, because historically it was mainly dominated by banks: central banks, commercial banks, investment banks and so on. Gradually, however, the number of other market participants increased, and now it includes many multinational corporations, global money managers, dealers, international money brokers, traders and also private speculators.</p>\n<p>The most important Forex market is the <em>spot market</em>, as its volume is the largest one. It’s called spot, because the trade is settled immediately, or “on the spot”. In practice it means two banking days. As you are interested in this domain, let me introduce to you, via my post, some related terms which are important if you want to be able to fully understand what’s going on in Forex trading.</p>\n<p>You’ll often come upon the term <em>spread</em>, which is the difference between the price that you can sell the currency at<em> Bid</em> and the price you can buy a currency at <em>Ask</em>. Bid is the price offered by the trader. It usually shows the highest price a purchaser will pay. Ask is the price requested by the trader, but this is the lowest price a seller will accept. The spread on majors is generally 3 pips in normal market conditions.</p>\n<p>Pip stands for percentage in point. It is the smallest price unit of a commodity or currency. In the Forex market prices are quoted to the fourth decimal point. When <strong>trading currency</strong>, you’ll hear very often that there is a 3-pip spread in trading majors.</p>\n<p>I hope that this modest introduction to<strong> Forex trading</strong> will aid you with a successful entry into the world of currency trading, where the knowledge of nuances and terms are indeed necessary to achieve the highest results.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>More often than ever mortgage brokers today are looking for a higher quality mortgage lead (and that answer may be<strong> telemarketing mortgage leads</strong>). But it seems that qualified and exclusive mortgage leads are coming more difficult to find. Many Internet mortgage leads are being generated through spam and other low quality mortgage lead generation methods. Everyday consumers are bombarded with unsolictied emails asking them to fill out forms requesting information on mortgage loans and refinancing information. This form of leads generation yeilds poor results. Mortgage brokers complain about the poor quality of these unqualified, non exclusive mortage leads that have been hit too many times before you even contact them.</p>\n<p>So are <strong>telemarketing mortgage leads</strong> the answer to this problem? Its safe to say the chance of getting a higher quality, qualified mortgage lead with telemarketing mortgage leads is much better than internet mortgage leads. With telemarketing mortgage leads you at least know that the consumer has been contacted and is truely interested, or was at one point interested, in aquiring mortgage related products.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, if you can find a company that provides good telemarketing mortgage leads at a resonable price and with lead exclusiveity stick with them. Beware of internet generated mortgage leads.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>With the latest happenings all around, one thing is pretty obvious and that’s basically the fact that consumer spending pattern has undergone a sea change over the past few years. This is more than expected for the financial turmoil that the nation has been through of late can’t be undermined and it has obviously had a direct impact on the consumer spending habits. Even at present you can’t really turn a blind eye to the fact that the Republican leadership is busy preparing to move a new strategy and that too around raising the debt ceiling of the nation. It’s not just about the small businesses having a tryst with debt; you’ve got the big business names involved too. Latest reports tell us that Apple Inc. happened to issue around 17 billion dollars in terms of bonds which is practically a record deal and it was spurred by efforts to placate its frustrated shareholders.</p>\n<h3>Instructions to help you negotiate and pay off business debt</h3>\n<p>As a business owner, it must obviously be one of your primary concerns to negotiate and pay off business debts. If the business is solely responsible for the debt, then personally you’re in a good position. Check out the following instructions as far as negotiation and payments are concerned.</p>\n<h3>Do consult with an attorney</h3>\n<p>It’s important that you consult with an attorney regarding whether or not your business debt is of a large or small amount. There are quite a few debt solutions companies available all around which you could consult as well. You need to provide the attorney with a copy of the credit card or perhaps loan agreement, including any collateral that might be involved.</p>\n<h3>Create the right strategy</h3>\n<p>You need to create the right strategy for negotiating debt based on liability. The best thing would be to settle the account for the full amount that’s owed. Another thing that could be done includes putting up a collateral be it your house or other real estate.</p>\n<h3>Stand for a different position</h3>\n<p>You need to take a different position if your business was formed as a limited liability company and happens to be solely responsible for the debt. This is because under such a scenario the lender shouldn’t be able to come after you personally.</p>\n<h3>Calculate your monthly profits</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve successfully negotiated the decided upon monthly payments for business debt, then it’s time you thought of making the payments and for that the first thing you’ve got to do is calculate your net monthly profits. This should be the amount that’ll be left over after you’ve paid your non-debt expenses. The remaining amount should then be directed towards allocating monthly debt expenses.</p>\n<h3>Identify the different debt terms</h3>\n<p>It’s extremely important that you identify which are your long term and which are your short term debts. This would indeed help you to decipher wherein you’ll be paying more amount as interest. The best idea, of course, would be to identify the high interest debts and start by paying them off first.</p>\n<p>The 5 instructions discussed above for the purpose of negotiating and paying off business debt is something that’s bound to help you go about things smoothly. Start working on it now for otherwise it just might be too late.</p>\n",

In case of homeowners, they have an option to pledge their homes and get cheap loans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your credit history also means a lot to the lenders. If you have a bad credit history, lenders would not be inclined to give you loans at cheap rates. Some concessions can be given to you if you are a homeowner. Tenants should never expect low rate loans if they have a low credit score. Your credit score enables a lender to judge your creditworthiness. This is the only way available to him to know about your precedents in the financial market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, secured homeowner loans involve a low rate of interest. These loans are a profitable option for the homeowners for the following reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cost efficient funds</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Extended repayment term</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wide and easy availability in the market</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>A loan amount that extends up to £250,000</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Fixed or variable rates</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are ready to give security to the lender (mostly your home), the loan process becomes very easy. Lenders take it as a positive and trustworthy sign. Even if you have a bad credit score, lenders may be willing to give you homeowner loans at competitive rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case of secured homeowner loans, the repayment terms are comparatively easier. Many lenders provide you an option to choose between fixed rate interest, variable rate interest and ‘Interest Only’ method of repayment. So, you can decide it according to your individual circumstances and preference. Sometimes lenders attach conditions like early repayment penalty that raises your cost of borrowing if you decide to repay your loan earlier than agreed. These fine prints in the loan agreement should be carefully read before you sign the agreement.</p>\n",

A refinance mortgage loan is a safer bet for lenders as a property means that they will have a confirmed means of regaining their debt even if lenders are unable to continue monthly payments. It is a riskier loan to borrowers than any other loan as your house is the collateral for the loan and if worse comes to worse you could end up losing your home.</p>\n<p><strong>The right decision</strong><br />\nThere is no other safer way than refinancing mortgage loan to get instant access to cash. Refinancing mortgage loan is the wisest way to pay off other debts which always act as throngs leading to sleepless nights. Drive all your credit worries away by going for a refinance mortgage loan.

      "content": "<p>Home insurance is unequivocally &nbsp;<strong>premier insurance</strong> that covers private homes providing compensation for damages or destruction.</p>\n<p>There are several factors that determine efficient <strong>home insurance prices</strong> and if you are going to purchase a new house or just want to increase insurance rates of your current home, you’d better keep them in mind.</p>\n<p>1. Location — The geographical area, where the home is located plays a role in&nbsp;<strong>home insurance prices</strong>. If the house is in a high risk area where the crime rate is high, your chances to <strong>get home insurance</strong> terms that you expect may drastically decrease.</p>\n<p>2. Construction — <strong>Home insurance prices </strong>also depend on the material and techniques used during the construction of the house. If materials like brick and concrete were used and the structure of the house is strong, the insurance rates will be lower.</p>\n<p>3. Condition — The overall condition of the house is another important factor determining your <strong>home insurance prices</strong>. And here the maturity of the house is going to play a role. Older houses cost more to insure. However, this factor is somewhat relative, because an older house may be well built while a newer one may have some problems with quality.</p>\n<p>4. Deductibles — Very important to note: a deductible is not covered by the insurance provider, but is paid out of pocket before the insurance claim is covered. The higher your deductibles are, the lower your rates will be. You are likely to save up to 50 percent of your homeowner’s insurance by raising deductibles.</p>\n<p>5. Claim history — This is another factor that determines the <strong>home insurance prices</strong>. Logically, if there are few or no claims on your house, there are chances that you will get the homeowner’s insurance plan that you want.</p>\n",

By signing up with an student debt consolidation curriculum, you will be in favor to begin a new credit with the lender.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fundamentally, this kind of curriculum falls under 2 categories:</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>1) Unsecured consolidation loan</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>2) Secured consolidation loan</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The earlier category of debt consolidation loan does not force you to raise collateral. Though you will require putting more finance for your monthly refund, you can induce this consolidation loan in a moderately rapid time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A secured consolidation loan in contrast, requires appropriate collateral and since you are not expected to hold properties of your own, you might require enrolling for assistance from your parents or custodian. With security, you can have a loan of more money but do make a note of the fact that the repayment phase for this loan group is typically longer than normal ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of student debt consolidation loans you begin with one loan with a small interest charge which is reasonable and which will assist you to perk up your credit score. Accepting this loan will discontinue any collection mediators harassing calls and provide you a strain free future to construct your credit for upcoming borrowing. Thus for easy repayment of the debts one should go for secured debt consolidation loans.</p>\n",

Motor trade insurance, in fact, is not just a necessity in running a motor trade business – it’s also a legal requirement. It doesn’t matter if you are a full time, part time, small time, or big time trader, you need a good motor trade insurance to protect your business</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of your responsibilities as a motor trader is making sure that all motor vehicles are kept in good shape while they’re in your possession. However, so many unwanted incidents can happen – breakdowns, theft, car wrecks, driving accidents, and many more. You will find your business in deep trouble if any of these events occur without a motor trade insurance to cover you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with the financial protection against physical damage to your motor vehicles as well as bodily injury caused by accidents provided by motor trade insurance, it would be easy to recover from your loss. Many different insurance providers provide different policies tailored to meet specific business needs, so take time to shop for the right insurance policy for your motor trade business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to find the right policy tailored for your business would be to arrange a consultation with advisers working for various policy providers. They will help outline the exact level of protection your own business requires. You can then compare the customized policies these advisers have prepared for you, and choose the one that provides the best coverage at a price you can afford.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many reputable motor trade insurance providers out there, it’d be fairly easy for you to find the best policy that fits your business needs.</p>\n",

By applying for a new balance transfer credit card, you can find out whether an issuer thinks your business is worth giving you a lower rate credit card. With 0% APR on certain balance transfers, you have a good chance of coming out ahead. Attempt to consolidate your credit card balances to only a few cards. With too many accounts open, you&#8217;re destined to lose track of due dates, rate changes, and other important details.</p>\n",

      "title": "Student Loan Consolidation May Get you Up to 20 More Years to Pay Off your Student Loans",
      "content": "\n<p>f you’re a former student or a college parent with any outstanding federal student loans, you may be able to get up to 20 more years to repay just by consolidating your eligible federal parent or student loans. With that longer repayment term, since you have more time to repay, the amount you have to pay each month will typically go down. You may be able to cut your monthly student loan payments by up to 42% — just by consolidating!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cut Your Payments on Your Student Loans by up to 42%</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s an example of how you can lower your monthly student loan payments when you consolidate your federal college loans and take advantage of a longer repayment term: Estimated monthly payments on a $75,000 student loan consolidation fixed at 7.25% and repaid over an extended term of 30 years are $512, versus estimated monthly payments of $879 on a $75,000 Federal Stafford Loan issued at 7.22% and repaid over 10 years — that’s a 41.8% reduction in monthly payment amount. (Your actual payment reduction may vary and will depend on the terms of the parent or student loans you’re consolidating.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Get More Time to Repay Your Student Loans</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Federal PLUS parent loans and Stafford student loans are issued with standard repayment terms of 10 years. You may be able to get up to 30 years to repay these federal parent and student loans when you consolidate them into a student loan consolidation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long you get to repay will depend on the total outstanding balance of your education debt: If your outstanding education debt totals $20,000 – $39,999, you’ll have 20 years to pay back your student loan consolidation.? If your outstanding education debt totals $40,000 – $59,999, you’ll have 25 years. If you have $60,000 or more in education debt when you consolidate your federal student loans, you’ll have 30 years to pay back your Federal student loan consolidation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>No Fees. No Credit Checks. No Prepayment Penalties.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though you can get more time to repay your federal parent and student loans by consolidating, there are no prepayment penalties on a Federal Consolidation Loan, so you won’t be assessed any additional fees for paying more than the minimum each month or for paying off your student loan consolidation early, should you choose to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also no application fees, no processing fees, and no credit checks when you consolidate through the federal student loan consolidation program.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Replace Your Variable-Rate Student Loans With a Fixed-Rate Consolidation Loan</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you took out your Federal PLUS Loans or Stafford Loans prior to July 1, 2006, those loans are subject to variable interest rates that will adjust every year. So when interest rates rise, your monthly student loan payments may also go up. But you can put an end to rate increases and rising payments when you consolidate your parent or student loans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The federal student loan consolidation program gives you the security of a fixed interest rate. By consolidating your federal</p>\n\n\n\n<p>student loans, you’ll replace your variable-rate college loans with a fixed-rate consolidation loan, so you won’t have to worry about interest rates rising and leaving you guessing about your monthly payment amount.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Make Just One Payment for All Your Federal Student Loans</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have multiple student loans in repayment and you’re dealing with the hassle of multiple bills, multiple due dates, and multiple monthly payments to multiple lenders, a Federal Consolidation Loan could help make your student loan repayment easier to manage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the federal student loan consolidation program, you can bundle all your eligible federal parent or student loans into one single consolidation loan with just one monthly bill, one lender, and one monthly payment that’s fixed for the life of your consolidation loan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Consolidate Your Private Student Loans</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have private student loans in addition to your federal student loans, you won’t be able to consolidate your private student loans under the federal student loan consolidation program. But you may be able to consolidate your private student loans separately with a Private Consolidation Loan, which offers the same convenience of a single consolidated loan for your private student loans.</p>\n",

      "title": "HOW TO GET HELP IF YOU’VE ALREADY TAKEN A LOAN",
      "content": "\n<p>If you’ve already taken a loan then don’t despair. You still have options. That being said, your options are not easy. Most people feel like they are caught in a trap that they can never get out of. Many of the people I and my business partners have helped call us hoping that we can just make the payments stop without destroying their credit. Some have already given up on their credit. Nonetheless, the bottom line is that whatever you do, you will still have to pay! Whether you pay off the loan, renegotiate the loan, hire a lawyer, or work through a debt consultant, you will have to pay some amount for something. There is no “free” solution to your problem, nor is there a stress-free solution to your problem. Alternatively, you can try and negotiate your debt problem yourself but, again, you will still have to deal with the pressure and hostility of the creditor(s). From experience, it seems that the creditors take the customer less seriously when negotiating their own debt than if they hire a lawyer, debt consultant, or other representative to do it for them. This doesn’t mean you can’t do it yourself, but you may experience more resistance than someone who is representing you. This is because someone with knowledge of consumer debt laws and regulations knows how far they can push the creditor. The creditor also knows this. The creditor also knows that if you are having trouble paying them, but are now diverting what little funds you have to pay someone to fight for you, then you must be serious about wanting to negotiate the debt. All things considered, what are your options?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do It Yourself. We don’t recommend this option because, in our experience, you may only provoke the creditor to pursue more aggressive debt collection options. They probably won’t take your seriously and you may end up making things worse. There are plenty of debt negotiation websites out there with all kinds of free advice, template letters, and other resources. Some of our clients have tried these solutions to no avail, which prompted them to seek our services. Of course, if you’re savvy, tenacious, and do the right research, you may just surprise yourself. But if you’re even the least bit unsure, you should seek professional assistance. And you don’t want to risk escalating poor relations or prompting a lawsuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hire A Lawyer. This is both your best and your most expensive option. If you can afford it, hiring a lawyer is a great way to send a message to creditors that you are serious about cleaning up your debt problems and bringing them to the negotiating table. Unfortunately, the legal fees will often cost more than the debt you owe, thus negating the whole point in hiring a lawyer. One of the advantages is that if you get sued, a lawyer can handle all of the litigation. Unless you can find a nonprofit law firm that specializes in debt issues, we don’t recommend this option due to the cost. According to the National Law Journal, the average cost of an attorney can be between $300 and $600 per hour.[viii] It isn’t hard to do the math and see that paying an attorney out-of-pocket will very likely cost you as much as you owe on the loan. Thus, “lawyering up” (as they say nowadays) will be cost-prohibitive to most people facing debt problems. Alternatively, a debtor can usually defend him or herself by hiring an experienced legal document assistant (LDA). While an LDA cannot represent you in court or give legal advice, they can can provide the information needed to make the right decisions and handle all of the paperwork and filings for you. Either way, hiring a lawyer is usually too cost-prohibitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Debt Consolidation. A debt consolidation loan can be a real stepping stone out of debts that you are having trouble repaying as long as you can afford this option. Taking out a loan and repaying all of your debts, including a high-interest loan from creditors, allows you to eliminate multiple accounts that all come with their own interest rates, terms, policies, and fees. Simply put, it is easier to keep track of one payment per month than several, and usually at a lower interest rate. Unfortunately, for people who looking for a way out of creditors’s web, this may only make matters worse. First, as mentioned above, taking a hard cash loan from creditors means you have an unsecured loan. creditors will have to jump through several legal hoops before they can lien your assets. Many debt consolidation loans are secured loans – loans that are backed by collateral, such as your home, car, and other assets. If you later have difficulty paying back your debt consolidation loan then the lender need only foreclose on your assets instead of taking you to court. The other problem is that if you don’t have enough assets to back the loan, your application probably won’t be approved anyway. And unsecured consolidation loans are even more difficult to obtain since the approval process relies on your credit history. Many victims of creditors’s scheme are probably not in a position to take on such a loan. And to make matters worse, such loans are often reported to the credit bureaus, which can affect your ability to obtain financing in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit Counselors. Credit counselors typically work with your creditors to lower interest rates and work out a repayment plan that it supposed to allow you keep your credit intact. Generally speaking, you make a payment to a bank or escrow account administered by the credit counselor, who then distributes the money to your creditors. From that payment, the credit counselor usually collects a percentage to cover their fee. Unfortunately, some companies have negligently allowed their client’s accounts to lapse for a month or more, which is reflected on their credit reports. These services may also take a larger proportion of the payment to cover their fees than they let on, so make sure you read the fine print. And always make sure they are actually making the payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Debt Consultants. Debt consultants, or debt negotiators, are similar to credit counselors in that they usually work with your creditors to lower interest and payments. But they differ in that debt consultants are essentially an agent, authorized by the client (you) by contract or power of attorney to negotiate on your behalf, but not to pay your creditors for you. And they do not take a percentage of the payment that is supposed to go to your creditors. Instead, debt consultants are paid directly by the client for this service (usually a flat fee) and the creditors are also paid directly by the client once a settlement is reached. Basically, debt consultants work more like a personal advocate or mediator. These kinds of consultants are not required to obtain any special licensing in the State of California. In theory, you can choose almost anyone that you trust or feel can effectively negotiate on your behalf to perform this service for you. But it is better to hire a professional debt consultant with experience in reaching these kinds of settlements. This is probably the most feasible solution for someone trying to work with creditors since they will usually pay a flat fee upfront. Furthermore, the client still maintains full control over the situation. Once the debt consultant reaches a settlement, they are basically out of the picture and the client pays the settlement either in a lump sum or by making drastically reduced monthly payments with no interest or fees. The only time the debt consultant would reappear in the case is if you are having trouble making the payments and need to negotiate even further. The drawback to utilizing this method is that most debt consultants require a fee upfront, which means that once they are paid they can skip out on your case or work lackadaisically, which could hurt your credit report if they don’t reach a settlement soon. Our firm offers debt consulting services but we have very strong contracts that uphold our clients’ confidentiality and only require half of the payment upfront, progress payments, or the balance due when the job is finished. We do this so that the client can rest assured that we won’t rest until the job is completed. If you can find a debt consultant that operates in a similar manner, then this may be your best and most affordable option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bankruptcy. If none of the other options are practical, then bankruptcy may be the only option left. Many people would rather avoid filing for bankruptcy since it practically destroys your credit and makes it difficult to rebuild, usually over the better part of a decade. Since many are able to handle their debts minus the creditors payment, they choose to instead work out a settlement with creditors to keep from completely ruining their credit report. Another reason not to press the bankruptcy button is that if you have already filed within the previous eight years, then filing for bankruptcy again will not do much good. According to Nolo Law, “[i]f you received your first discharge under a Chapter 7, you cannot receive a second discharge in any Chapter 7 case that is filed within eight years from the date that the first case was filed.”</p>\n",

      "title": "About The Loan Process",
      "content": "\n<h4>1) Arrange A Pre-qualified Loan</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have not started your property search, or are still looking, a pre-qualified loan can be useful. It gives you a clear picture of what your spending limits are and gives you peace of mind that if you find a property that you are really interested in, you can move quickly to make an offer. And it may put you in a stronger negotiating position than other potential buyers who do not have a pre-qualification. A mortgage broker can take care of the paperwork to lodge a loan application.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 2) Find Your Property</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you do plenty of homework when you are on the hunt for a new property. Research property prices in the area, potential capital growth and existing and planned infrastructure, such as roads, public transport, schools and shops. If you are unfamiliar with property values in the area, consider a full valuation carried out by a registered valuer before making a final decision.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 3) Make An Offer &amp; Sign A Contract Of Sale</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you buy a property at auction or make an offer on a listing, your agreement with the vendor only becomes a legal commitment when a Contract of Sale (Offer of Acceptance in WA) has been signed by both parties. This contract will confirm the selling price as well as any terms and conditions. Your commitment will usually be subject to lender approval, a building inspection report and a pest inspection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The period from signing a Contract of Sale to Settlement – when the property becomes legally yours – is usually six weeks (shorter in some states, such as Queensland). Note: even if you have a pre- approved loan, your lender will still need to complete a valuation of the property you have chosen before issuing full approval.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 4) Pay A Deposit</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A deposit is required once a Contract of Sale has been signed by both parties (sometimes called ‘exchanging contracts.’) You won’t yet have access to your home loan, so your deposit will need to come from savings or elsewhere. You may also be able to arrange a deposit bond until settlement. Speak to one of our friendly staff about your deposit options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 5) Appoint A Conveyancer</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You will need a solicitor or conveyancer to check the legalities of the Contract of Sale. Your conveyancer will also check that all rates and taxes have been paid, check land use or building approvals for the property and order any relevant searches. They may also help sort out any inspections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On settlement day, the conveyancer will check that the correct amount of money has been transferred from your lender to the seller and all fees – such as Stamp Duty – are paid, so you can take legal ownership of the property.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 6) Cooling Off Period (not valid for WA)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you did not buy your property at auction, you may have a cooling off period when you can cancel the contract, although there may be a small penalty. Cooling off periods vary from state to state so check with your relevant state authority in terms of what your rights may be. In Western Australia, however, the Offer of Acceptance is binding.  </p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Whenever it makes financial sense to do so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heard about mortgage refinancing? In the past, most people who took out a mortgage doggedly continued with it until they had paid it off. These days, people refinance their mortgage much more frequently. The average duration of a home loan in Australia now is just 4-5 years. Here, we look at some of the reasons why people in Australia refinance their home loan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 1) Lower Rate</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common reason for people to refinance their mortgage is to get a better deal. But be careful you do not become interest rate-fixated. When you refinance your home loan, you need to consider fees and charges as well as the interest rate. You often have to pay charges for exiting your current home loan, plus charges for taking out the new mortgage. You need to be sure that in refinancing your home loan that you will be better off in the long run after taking into account all costs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 2) More Flexibility</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people only discover the full details about their mortgage when it is too late. They try to do something and get told by their lender that either they cannot do it, or they will incur a hefty charge if they do. An example is a redraw facility – the ability to pay extra money into a mortgage and then redraw it later. This feature is not possible with a basic home loan, so many people refinance their mortgage to give themselves this sort of increased flexibility.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 3) Renovation</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you carry out renovations, it often makes sense to refinance your mortgage and take out a construction loan so you only pay interest as building progresses. Once construction is over, it might make sense to refinance your home loan again so that you consolidate the total amount you owe into a loan that minimises your interest bill, while giving you a degree of liquidity.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 4) Home Equity</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Over recent years in the property market, houses have appreciated at a significant rate. e.g. a home you bought for $300,000 five years ago, might now be worth $500,000. Refinancing your mortgage with a home equity loan might let you tap into that extra $200,000 equity.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 5) Defaulting</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people find they have borrowed more than they can comfortably repay, and they are in danger of defaulting. There is no shame in that. But do not suffer in silence. If you are having trouble making your mortgage repayments, talk to Ion Loans about refinancing your home loan to make it more manageable.</p>\n",

Shown below are 5 things that every purchaser should know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><br> 1) Think About Why You Want To Buy A Property</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to live in it or will it be an investment property? This can help determine the kind of loan you apply for and property you buy, depending on your short and long-term plans.   </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><br> 2) Research Potential Properties &amp; Loans</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing the market is crucial, so do some research on the areas you are targeting, check out auction clearance rates and recent sales, as well as price trends in the area. Once you are aware of what you are looking for and the approximate price, the next step is saving a deposit.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some lenders will offer loans if you have saved less than the usual 20 per cent deposit, being able to show a record of good saving habits will aid in getting your loan approved. Contact Ion Loans to talk about applying for pre-approval on the right type of loan and what you can afford in terms of repayments.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 3) Factor In Other Costs Involved</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the property, there can be a number of additional costs, so ask us what other payments you will face. This can include, but is not limited to; stamp duty, loan establishment fees, legal and conveyance services, utilities, property insurance, maintenance and lenders mortgage insurance.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4> 4) Think About Your Future</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because your current situation allows you to get a home loan, that does not automatically guarantee that you will still be able to service it in five years’ time. Is there a possibility your role at work will change? Are you considering going back to study and reducing your working hours?   <br>\n5) Get Professional Help</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many things to consider, getting professional help is highly recommended. There are many experts in the industry and it is in your best interest to use them for tasks such as property checks, pest checks and any other legal queries. Going it alone can prove costly. Avoid nasty surprises down the track by getting the right people to do the appropriate checks for you from the beginning.

Whether it’s a car repair, a speeding ticket, a tuition bill, a medical bill, a utility bill, an upcoming vacation, or something else altogether, there are times when you need money, and you need it now. Asking friends and family for a loan can be awkward and unpleasant. You may not have a credit card available to use. Regardless of the reason you need cash, we can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cash advance is when money is advanced to you between paydays. You agree to pay all or a portion of the cash advance back on your next payday, plus interest. One of the advantages of our site is that applying for a cash advance is quick and easy. Simply fill out the brief online application; there are usually no documents to fax. Speak to a loan agent to verify your information, and your cash could be on it’s way as soon as the next business day. The funds are electronically deposited directly into your checking account and should be immediately available for your use. No need to explain why you need the money; simply apply for the amount you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualifying for a loan is also a breeze. There’s no credit check, so even if you have a bankruptcy, delinquent accounts, bounced checks, or charge-offs in your financial history, you can still qualify. You just need to have a job or other regular source of income, make at least $800 per month, be 18 years old or older, and have a checking account. Of course, other requirements may apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loan amount you qualify for is based on your income and other factors, and may be as much as $1,500. The interest rate might seem a bit steep, but keep in mind this is a loan you can qualify for quickly and easily. Your loan paperwork will clearly outline the interest rate and other repayment terms, and you’re welcome to call anytime with any questions or concerns you may have.

Apply for a cash advance through a reputable lender and get the cash you need as soon as tomorrow. There’s nothing to lose and peace of mind to gain.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<h4>Is Cost The Only Price To Consider When You Compare Motor Trade Insurance?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been a motor trader long enough, you’d know how price sensitive the automotive industry is. It follows then that in order to not only thrive, but also succeed in the motor trading business, you as a business owner, need to be price sensitive yourself. This means that you will have to spend more time shopping around for the best deals when it comes to buying, repairing, and selling a motor vehicle. Being price-sensitive also means keeping a close tab on how much you’re paying for motor trade insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motor trade insurance expense, after all, is most likely one of the biggest outgoings you see in your income statement each year. So, does this mean that when you compare motor trade insurance quotes, you automatically settle for the cheapest one? Absolutely not! When an insurance company’s adviser gives you a quote that’s really cheap compared to others, then it is strongly recommended that you proceed with caution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s more to a good motor trade insurance policy than just the price. Your utmost goal when you compare motor trade insurance policies is to find one that not only provides a cheap quote but also – and more importantly – the right level of protection your business set up needs. However, if you are just in the start up stage of your business and your knowledge on how to compare motor trade insurance is limited, then your best option would be to seek the help of an insurance broker who specializes in the automotive industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the broker’s job to find a company that can provide an affordable, and if possible, a tailored insurance plan that provides financial protection for your motor trading business in the event of theft, collision, or other vehicle-related mishaps. Hiring the services of a good insurance broker is also beneficial when it comes making a claim. The best can help you get the claim settled rather quickly and favorably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The motor trade industry is a lucrative business, but it can easily be something you can fail at without the right motor trade insurance plan to protect it.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Securing motor trade insurance is a legal requirement in the UK,USA or Canada for all full-time motor traders. If you are involved in the motor trade industry but only trading part-time, do you still need insurance? The answer is yes. The policy tailored to meet the specific needs of a part-time motor trader is called part time motor trade insurance. It is designed for individuals who still keep a day job while running a motor trading business on the side for additional income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note though that not only part-time business owners can avail of this type of insurance, but everyone who work within the motor trade industry – vehicle salesmen, repairmen, maintenance men, or part time employees of a motor trading business – as well. Securing part time motor trade insurance in the UK, however, may not be as simple as you’d think. Here’s why:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Many insurance providers avoid part time motor traders</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><br> Insurers tend to perceive a part time trader to be a higher risk compared to someone who’s running a full time motor trading business. The reason behind this is because, as they are only doing this part time and not fully depending on this trade as their only source of income, they may become careless.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Part time traders undergo more scrutiny by insurers</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><br> Let’s say you found a reputable insurance provider that does offer part time motor trade insurance. You’re still not out of the woods yet. Almost all insurers (and even brokers) insist that you present proof that you are indeed operating as a part time motor trader. This has become a prerequisite since it has been found that some people have taken out motor trade insurance as opposed to the regular motor insurance policy to protect their personal vehicles even though they are not in anyway involved in the motor trading business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance companies are known to do spot checks to confirm the existence of invoices, receipts, and other documentations that prove you are a motor trader. If you are looking to take out a part time trade insurance in the UK, know though that is not impossible to get one, so long as you take the time to shop around.</p>\n",

You’d be surprised at how low the offers they give you compared to the offers you receive directly from insurance providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting paid the right amount on your claims – fast<br>\nPerhaps the best thing about insurance brokers is that not only do they help you get the money you deserve on the claims you file, they also help speed up the process.

      "content": "\n<p>Limitations Under a Motor Trade Insurance Under 25 Policy</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking out motor trade insurance that meets your business needs as well as your budget is challenging enough. It becomes even tougher when you’re under the age of 25.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because insurance companies see young drivers as high risk compared to individuals who are in their 30’s or older. If you’ve just started looking for motor trade insurance under 25, you’d soon find out that not every insurance company is welcoming you with open arms. And even if you found an insurance provider willing to provide you with a Motor Trade Insurance Under 25 policy, there are requirements and restrictions that you have to meet to qualify.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><br> In the UK, you would have to be at least 18 years old to apply for Motor Trade Insurance Under 25. You also must have held a European driving license for at least 1 year to be considered. Though they claim that you have to be at least 18, most insurance providers do not accept applicants under the age of 23.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re below 23, then your best chance of getting a motor trade insurance would be to hire an insurance brokerage firm who can do all the hard work of finding an insurance provider willing to entertain your application.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Vehicles</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><br> One common restriction imposed by insurance companies is related to the performance of the vehicles you can drive. For example, some companies do not allow policyholders under the age of 21 to drive turbo-charged vehicles, and if you’re 21-24 years old, you may not be able to file a claim if you meet an accident while driving a Ferrari or a Subaru.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motor trade insurance under 25 is not only for business owners at the age of 18 and above. They are also for motor traders who employ someone under the age of 25. Understand that this type of insurance calls for a higher monthly premium, so if you wish to take out a motor trade insurance under 25 – whether for yourself or for an employee – seek the help of an insurance brokerage firm to find the best insurance deal.</p>\n",

You need to look after instances when you may have to spend unnecessarily. For these instances, people get motor trade insurance online quote. Motor trade insurance policies can come in handy both for businesses and for employees. Before you even consider and go for a motor trade insurance online quote, it is imperative to first know a few things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know the policy that you need?<br>\nNot all motor trade insurance policies are the same. There are different types of policies that are applicable to some businesses, which may not be useful to your situation. For instance, if you have a car rental business, pretty much, you need a different policy when you have a restoration shop. Before any type of quote, you need to make sure that you have done your own share of consultation with the insurance company. Here, they can evaluate things that can get your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What should be included?<br>\nIt is highly suggested that you take the premises or the building included in your insurance policy. You want to protect the premises from any incident of fire, theft or any untoward incident like a natural calamity. With the right policy covering the building, you can guarantee return of your operations in the shortest period of time without spending anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you might be concerned about the daily income that you are supposed to get when the repair and the restoration is being done in case any of the incidents happen. For these occurrences, you do not have to worry because loss of income coverage can provide you with the necessary income when waiting for the construction to finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about the equipment? There is a different type of insurance policy for the tools and equipment. When getting these things insured, you need to have a complete inventory. You need to be completely honest about the things that you declare in order for the insurance company to cover them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last thing that you want to check is the liability coverage. This means that you can protect your company for any claims made against you. Though you may be careful of not committing any health and safety hazard in your workplace, there will be instances when some accidents just happen.</p>\n",

Many people find it difficult to make their car payments and have even more difficulty paying their car accident insurance. The trick to easing this difficulty is to find affordable car insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While finding affordable car insurance may sound like a good idea, it is not as easy as one may think. It requires a lot of active research on the soon to be insured’s part. Many companies will base your rate on various factors such as age, gender, driving history, and your location. Different insurance companies offer different kinds of discounts based on positive factors such as a good driving record or high grades in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often time’s people make the mistake of assuming that all insurance companies will charge about the same because of the similar discounts. The truth is these insurance companies are competing with each other to get your business. This puts you at an advantage over the insurance companies when it comes to finding affordable car insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this in mind do not be afraid to talk to multiple insurance companies, analyze the type of coverage your need and go with the company that offers you the best deal and the most coverage at an affordable rate that wont break your bank.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Senior citizen drivers are considered to be high-risk drivers by auto insurance companies. Therefore, it is very important that senior citizen drivers get the appropriate auto insurance coverage if they are going to continue to drive. Seniors are considered to be high-risk motorists because of the likeliness of them to not be paying attention while on the road, or going through red lights due to slower reflexes or poor eyesight. Because of this seniors will get higher auto insurance company quotes or see their current rates rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seniors who are 75 or over get the highest rates because of the risk they are to insurers due to their high rate of accidents involving the death of them or the other parties. To reduce this risk some insurers are beginning to require that senior motorists take a safe driving course designed specifically for them. While other providers don&#8217;t make the safe driving course a requirement they will offer discounts to mature drivers who take the course. This is one way senior drivers can save on their auto insurance rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the safe driving courses offered by many companies is called the 55 Alive. This course was designed specifically for seniors and is offered through many AARP chapters. The course describes the many aspects of driving that the elderly should become aware of and also the type of car that is best for them. The course explains that a car that allows for free movement, the ability to clearly see the road, easy to use seat belts, lightweight doors and fully adjustable seats. It is beneficial for older motorists not only because they can get a discount on their policy but they can also learn a lot of ways to keep themselves and others safe while on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course also goes to explain the importance of mature drivers being aware of the way their medications may impair their abilities and reflexes. This is important because, while driving, a senior motorist must be completely alert and ware of everything going on around them not just the individual in front of them. Many insurers praise safe driving classes for senior drivers because they explain very important pointers to senior motorists and even allow them to examine if they feel they are still able to drive safely.</p>\n",

      "title": "Safe Driving Can Get You A Discount on Your Car Insurance",
      "content": "\n<p>The idea of safe driver discounts came about so that auto insurance companies can reward their customers for being safe drivers. It also wasn&#8217;t too much of a risk as it was still safe to reward a discount to a driver that was less likely to have to file a claim. Auto insurers also saw it as a way to be fair to responsible policyholders and not penalize them by charging them the same rate they were charging riskier motorists. If you consider yourself a good driver and it is proven in your driving record, you should start searching for auto insurance company quotes that give you a discount for being a responsible motorist. You may not get this safe driver discount if you simply feel you are a good driver but your driving record says otherwise. However, if you are a proven safe motorist you should learn a bit about policies and the different pieces of them before you go searching for discounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are out looking for cheap auto insurance company quotes, you must familiarize yourself with premiums before you start comparing quotes and companies. A quote may be lower than the others because they offer less than them. In this case the quote isn&#8217;t lower because the policies aren&#8217;t the same. When looking at a car insurance quote you should look at the cost but also look at the type of coverage, up to what amount are you covered?, type of car, usually some insurers will charge more for certain types of cars, company profile, how long have they been in business? Are they a reputable company? Are they known for paying on their claims? All of this should be factored into the price estimate and then used to compare the different quotes you get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again you are only considered a responsible motorist to an insurer if you haven&#8217;t been in an accident or have only had one accident, this depends on the provider, and have little to no traffic violations including parking tickets. So if you want to get a safe drivers credit and don&#8217;t fit into this category, you may have to wait a while before you are given the chance again. Then and only then will you get the opportunity to get price estimates that will include a good driver discount.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Some people are choosing to drop some of their auto insurance coverage in an attempt to save more money. Some have even decided to go without a policy all together. This can be very dangerous for them as well as other drivers around them. If they were to get into an accident with another driver that doesn&#8217;t have insurance they will have to pay for any damage done to their car and to any other public property. If another driver gets into an accident with them the other driver will have to cough up the expenses of the damage caused. This is a great risk to take considering the amount of money it costs to fix a car or take car of someone else&#8217;s hospital or doctor bills. Therefore, if you are thinking about reducing your coverage or canceling your plan all together you should think again. Try thinking about other options such as comparing prices from the many other car insurance companies available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two problems with surpassing the opportunity to get auto insurance company quotes and choosing to put yourself at risk. If you lessen your coverage you may come to the realization, if you are ever in a car accident, that the little amount of money you were saving by decreasing coverage doesn&#8217;t compare to the amount of out of pocket expense you are now facing by having to repair your car. And let&#8217;s not mention the unfortunate incident of having to take of your hospital bills as well as any other person involved in the accident. The point here is that it is too risky to not have enough protection. Your little savings could cost you a lot in the long run. It could even cost you your car if you are unprepared or unable to pay for the repair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other problem with not getting quotes and completely getting rid of your plan is the risk you face if you are ever pulled over by the police. If you are pulled over by an officer and don&#8217;t have the appropriate coverage required by your state, you could be fined or penalized. These are usually very expensive. More expensive than the amount you may be saving by not having a policy. In some states you can also have your driving privileges suspended and your car registration suspended as well. This means you no longer have any transportation to go to work and make money to pay any of your bills.</p>\n",

You just have to know the tricks of the trade and prepare yourself before you go inquiring. You first want to research the many different auto insurance companies and choose two or three of the ones you would like to do business with. Not every search will come up with benefits. A lot of the positive results will come from your driving record and the length of time you have been driving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing to remember is if you were to get cheap auto insurance company quotes you will have to keep up whatever it was that got you the quotes in the first place or else you risk losing your low rate. For instance, if you were given a lower rate for being a student or a safe driver and you no longer are a student or your driving record becomes not so good, your auto insurance company will decrease your discount and increase your rate. So be sure to keep your promise and stay the person you were when you received the cheap auto insurance company quote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When looking for a great deal on coverage that will give you peace of mind you want to be sure to shop around. Don&#8217;t just go with the premium you think is fair without doing further research. There may be other companies offering even lower premiums and you could risk the chance of getting one of them if you jump at the first rate you think is really low. A beneficial tool to use when searching for an affordable policy would be our innovative quote tool. It allows you to input all of your information into the system and exactly what it is you are looking for from a company and then delivers quotes from as many of the top 10 insurers that meet your search directly into your email. If you don&#8217;t want them to flood your email, because they will, you can have them call you. Whichever method you prefer is fine just as long as you make yourself available for their response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have received price estimates, you can now review and compare the best pricing, which they are and what they offer. You can even prepare a side-by-side comparison chart that lets you clearly see where each company stands in comparison to one another. Knowing what each auto insurance company offers will give you a strong footing when negotiating a price. When you know what the best insurer offers that the other one doesn&#8217;t you can bring this up to them to negotiate a cheaper price.</p>\n",

      "title": "Cheap Life Insurance",
      "content": "\n<p>One source of cheap life insurance is Group Life Insurance. This type of insurance is generally offered through your place of employment. Because many individuals are covered under a Group Life Insurance plan, the rates your employer offers tend to be very affordable. While Group Life Insurance may sound enticing, realize that the coverage being offered is usually not going to be enough to meet the needs of you and your family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, it might be necessary to supplement this cheap source of life insurance with another policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Two big assumptions</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How can an employer offer such cheap life insurance? Typically, the employer acts as the owner of the policy and participating employees are considered the insured. Under this scenario, the insurance agency calculates its risks based on a “pool” of individuals. Agents start with the assumption that it is extremely unlikely all or even a significant portion of the insured will die at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The insurance company also assumes that not everyone will work at that place of employment until retirement age. What that means to the insurance company is that it will be covering the group for a shorter term than it would when only insuring an individual. These two assumptions alone enable the insurance company to offer significantly reduced rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How much do employees contribute?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A company that offers group life insurance to its employees may offer participation in the group plan at no cost to employees. That’s definitely cheap life insurance! Life insurance in this case is promoted as a company benefit. When employees don’t pay into their life insurance plans, their death benefits generally are equal to one year of salary. Sometimes a company offers more benefits to management or to union employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case where an employee has the option to voluntarily contribute money towards the Group Life Insurance plan, death benefits generally are much more substantial. When an employee contributes, it’s usually also possible for the employee’s spouse and child(ren) to get life insurance coverage under the Group Life Insurance plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is it usually cheaper to get life insurance through a Group Insurance Plan, employees benefit in another way. They usually won’t have to take a medical exam. In other words, an employee is insurable even if he or she has a preexisting medical condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re looking for cheap life insurance, don’t overlook your employer. It’s a reliable source even if it’s necessary to supplement this source. If you do decide to pursue this option, it’s important to thoroughly understand the company policy as it applies to life insurance. In particular, you want to know what happens to the policy should you decide to voluntarily terminate your employment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The policy typically terminates upon your departure; however, some company policies offer the option of continuing the Group Insurance Plan. In this situation, employees should expect to pay more out of pocket expenses. Even so, it’s still going to be a cheap source of life insurance.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>It is an old saying — “Health is Wealth.” The most important step to maintain this wealth is to get a health insurance policy for you as well as your family. But, sometimes the premiums of such policies can leave you in and out of the budget situation. Can you really do something to bring down your premium? Read on to learn about the 5 quickest ways to lower your health insurance premium.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Adopt a healthy lifestyle</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Living a healthy life has many benefits. Your healthy lifestyle can easily help you in bringing down the health insurance premium. Exercise regularly, eat healthy diet, avoid smoking and heavy drinking — and your visits to the doctor will surely be minimized. The healthier you are, the lesser you are represented as a risk for the insurance company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Shop for the best available price</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best options to keep your premium lowest is to go out and shop around for the health care policy. This will ensure that you find the best available policy that fits in your budget. Do a thorough research before investing in any policy. You can get information from your friends and relatives or even Internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Take up plans with higher deductibles</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance plans with higher deductibles tend to have lower premiums. Typically, deductible is the amount you are expected to pay toward hospital, doctor, and other medical bills. Taking up a plan with a higher deductible may not be a universally applicable idea. If you’re generally healthy and do not fall ill very frequently, then you can take up this plan. This way you can keep your premium at a lower rate and avail basic health care facilities as well. But, if you have a history of some major consistent illness, avoid taking this plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Take up a policy early in your life</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The premium varies to a great extent with the age of the person. Try and get a policy as early in your life as you can. For example, if you buy a policy at the age of 25, then you’ll have to pay lesser premium but, if you go for the same policy at the age of 50 you’ll end up paying a raised premium amount.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Get in touch with independent insurance agents</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You can take help from independent insurance agents. These agents represent several insurance agencies and can guide you to pick the right kind of health insurance policy and then plan your premiums at an affordable rate. Since independent agents will compete to get the business – so you’ll get serious offers quickly.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Many people complain of having outrageously high car insurance quotes. It seems like everyone has to pay extremely high car insurance payments because of the mistakes of few. However, you should not be discouraged. There are simple things that you can do to significantly lower your car insurance quotes. In turn, you will have more money to spend on other things, and you won’t have to cringe every time your insurance bill comes in the mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the easiest ways to lower quotes is to pay a higher deductible. Many people try to get the lowest deductible possible because they think it will save them money in the long run. In reality, paying a higher deductible will lower your periodic premium amount. This is great if you are an extremely careful driver and are not particularly worried about being in many accidents. It should be noted that paying a higher deductible will mean that if something does happen to your vehicle you will have to pay more for the initial expenses before you even go in for a claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great way to lower quotes is to take a defensive driving course, or if you are in school, get good grades. Many people do not take advantage of these breaks offered by insurance companies. In fact, taking a state-approved defensive driving course can give you discounts of up to 10% on a premium. Discounts for good grades can also save you some decent cash. It is a good idea to check with your insurance company to see if they offer discounts, and how much they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parking in a garage is also a great way to lower quotes. In certain situations, this can take off almost 20% of a premium. This percentage is so high because in a garage a vehicle is less likely to get stolen or vandalized. Additionally, a car in a garage is less likely to be damaged by other cars. Insurance companies are always rewarding lower-risk clients; so parking in a garage can make you one of these preferred clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the best way to lower your car insurance quotes is to simply take the time to shop around. Different companies offer different rates. One company may judge you as high risk and not offer you the best rate. At the same time, another company may judge you as lower risk and therefore give you a better rate. Searching for quotes is not difficult, and can even be done online. Lowering car insurance quotes may seem like a daunting task, but following a few simple tips can drastically reduce your payments.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>A Dental plan is an option for people who do not wish to spend much money on ‘full coverage’ with dental insurance. Such plans are provided by certain companies, who charge monthly fees from their clients. There are many dental plans available for residents in the US. The three basic plans are HMO, PPO, and EPO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HMO stands for Health Management Organizations. Their plans are also called Capitation Dental Plans. Providers of these plans associate themselves with a single dentist who willingly agrees to reduce his fees by attracting a larger number of patients. The responsibility of the provider company is to attract more patients to the contracted dentist and to provide the discounted services of the dentist to his patients. As per this plan, simple cleaning and filling procedures cost almost nothing to the patient. For more complex procedures like root canals, crown filling, bridgework, and dentures, there can be a collaborative payment between the provider company and the patient. The contracted dentist gets a monthly payment depending on the number of patients who visited during the month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other plan PPO, which stands for Preferred Provider Organization, is only slightly different from the HMO plan. PPO plan is a closed plan, in which the provider companies associate themselves with a group of dentists practicing in an area. The advantage of enrolling in a PPO is that the patient gets to choose among several dentists according to their preference. This plan provides a discounted service as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EPO is Exclusive Provider Organization. It is also a closed plan with a group of contracted dentists like the PPO, but the difference is that the patient cannot choose the dentist from the group; the provider decides which dentists are seen by its clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies provide dental plans for their employees as an added perk. Usually PPO and EPO plans are favored by employee groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All dental plans provide free preventive services for their clients. By doing so, they avert huge medical bills in the case of a serious dental condition in the future. There are limitations on the number of free services provided per year, which is mentioned in the dental plan’s stipulations. For more expensive operations the dental plan provider may pay as much as 50-80% of the total bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dental provides detailed information on Dental Insurance, Dental Plans, Dental Implants, Dental Health and more. Dental is affiliated with Dental Health Care.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>A look at the factors one should consider when looking to obtain a home mortgage loan with bad credit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a low credit score can make life difficult. Whether you obtained it through the use of credit cards, student loans that have accumulated due to interest over time or even just bad investments, a bad credit score can complicate some of the most important steps in your life, such as buying your first home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to purchase a home and obtain a home mortgage loan is one that people with bad credit must consider extensively, weighing the pros and cons and also analyzing their financial records to formulate a calculated, well-thought out decision. Read on for an overview of obtaining a home mortgage loan with bad credit, as well as tips for aiding the process of getting a home loan with as low of an interest rate as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> “Buying a Home with Bad Credit”</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have bad credit, purchasing a house can is a financial investment that you must consider even more so than the average buyer. While today’s market has been described as the “buyer’s market,” the standards to obtain a home mortgage loan have increased in wake of the economic crisis and become much more scrutinizing. What this essentially means for a buyer with bad credit is that they will need more cash on the table when it comes to closing the sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A home loan generally requires 10 to 20 percent of the settled cost, as well as closing costs. Finding out exactly how much you have available to spend on a home – and subsequent monthly mortgage payments – is crucial here, as this number will determine a target amount for your down payment savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> “Home Mortgage Tips for People with Bad Credit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Some tips to consider for home buyers with bad credit:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>– Look for houses that are below your budget; a home that is modestly priced will have a cheaper down payment to save up for. Having more cash up front can help you acquire a loan that isn’t inflated with high interest rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>– Don’t choose a loan that pushes your monthly budget to its limit; interest can increase over time, and you don’t want to have to sacrifice other bills in favor of a mortgage payment, as the missed payments on other financial obligations will only further worsen your credit score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>– If possible, take some time to improve your score before buying a home. There are many credit recovery companies online that have year-long options that will help you restructure your finances and boost your score, and ultimately this will help you obtain a loan with much lower interest rates when you purchase a home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>– Consider companies such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) who specialize in home mortgages and loans for low-income buyers or those with bad credit; their loans can require as little as 3.5 percent down as opposed to the median 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> “Summary”</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>People with bad credit do not have to put their lives on hold, but they do have to take additional precautions when buying a home. Some lenders with extremely high interest rates specifically target those with bad credit who feel as if there is “no other option.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Know how much you can comfortably afford to spend, check for properties that are below your budget and shop around for vendors before closing any deals to ensure that you are getting the best loan possible and not subjecting yourself to unreasonably high interest rates that cost hundreds of extra dollars per month.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>An introductory guide on to increase your credit score and improve your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad credit can impact your life in a variety of negative ways; from loan approval to being denied a rental contract or mortgage to even affecting potential employment opportunities. When your bad credit begins to affect the most crucial areas of your life, it also begins to become detrimental to your self-esteem. However, there is hope. You can begin today to reevaluate your financial habits, implement new, more effective ones, and start on the path that won’t just increase your credit score, but also your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> “Credit Repair”</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, the task of repairing your credit on your own is just too overwhelming. You may have tried many times in the past and began to succeed, only to be hit by a financial crisis and find yourself right back where you started, or maybe even worse off than before. This can be incredibly discouraging and lead to a sense of hopelessness and incapability, but the great news is that even if you’ve struggled to fix your credit and even if it’s lower than ever, it is still possible to improve your score.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> “What is credit repair?”</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit repair, a service offered through licensed credit repair companies, is a method of financial techniques and habits that will help a person who is affected by a low credit score improve their standing over a period of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you decide to work with a credit repair company, you will be working with a team of skilled professionals who are well-versed in the practice of improving low credit scores and won’t just help you organize all of your outstanding balances and debts, but also educate you on financial habits that work and will help you not just raise you credit score, but also begin to put money away into savings and lay the foundations for your financial future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> “How Credit Repair Works”</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit repair companies like Prime National Credit Repair will assign you a licensed credit repair consultant who will first begin by reviewing your current financial standing. This means drawing a credit report, which although it can hurt your score if done too often, is critical to the process of understanding all of your present debts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your consultant has assessed how much money you owe and to which companies, he or she can begin working with you to create a personalized repair plan. This includes contacting the companies you have outstanding balances with to make sure that you are paying the right amount as according to your income. They can also contact the credit bureaus and ensure that all of the changes you agreed upon have been properly implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> “Credit Repair and You”</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many steps you can take without a company to improve your credit score, but in most cases, entrusting a specialized credit repair service provider will help not just reduce stress and facilitate the process of paying back your debts, but also provide you with valuable techniques and information that you can keep in mind and continue to practice after you have finished with the company and use to continue to improve your credit score.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Tips on getting an affordable mortgage for home buyers with low credit scores, in a timely manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because you have bad credit doesn’t mean you have to put major life events such as buying a home on hold. People who want to get a mortgage loan with bad credit have various resources available to them that can help them not only obtain a loan that has a relatively low interest rate (which will vary depending on the particular credit score), but is also affordable and will help them increase their credit score over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3> “Planning for a Home Mortgage Loan with Bad Credit”</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have bad credit, it’s necessary to know exactly how much you earn annually, as well as how much income is at your disposal each month after the deduction of bills and living expenses. This number will allow you to estimate how much you could comfortably afford to spend on a mortgage payment. From that point forward, you can begin to look at properties with your budget in mind, and put money away for the down payment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People with bad credit will face more difficulty getting approved for a home loan than those with fair credit standing, as well as higher interest rates. For this reason it is recommended to have the money for the down payment saved, which is on average 20 percent of the settled cost of the home, as well as funds to cover additional closing costs. You want to borrow a loan that has as low of an interest rate as possible, and reducing the initial amount you need to take by saving up a large sum of money beforehand is the ideal method.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3> “Mortgage Companies for People with Bad Credit”</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many companies that assist individuals who have low income or bad credit in financing the purchase of a home. One such company is the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). A housing loan from the FHA can require as little as 3.5 percent of the closing price as opposed to 10 to 20 percent with an average loan vendor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FHA has a home mortgage loan that was designed specifically for eligible buyers who have had credit troubles in the past and are now left with a low credit score that is complicating the process of being approved for a home mortgage or finding a loan that doesn’t have exorbitant interest rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take note that these loans are not intended for individuals who are still struggling to make payments on other outstanding balances. If you are still dealing with a variety of payments that you find difficult to afford, now should be the time you focus on repairing your credit and paying off debts. The last thing you should do is take on a home mortgage that is ultimately foreclosed upon and plunges your credit score even lower. A foreclosure also makes purchasing any home in the future very difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FHA loan for buyers with bad credit is insured by the federal government, and the qualifying standards are much less scrutinizing than those of a traditional mortgage. You can visit the page with more detailed information here and check your eligibility.</p>\n",

Home improvement grants for people with bad credit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2> Eligibility Regardless of Credit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you want to fix up your home to sell it, rent it out, or simply upgrade a room or two, you may be eligible for a home improvement loan. Many homeowners are under the impression that they need excellent credit to be approved for this type of loan, but this is not the case anymore due to the lender options that are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have filed for bankruptcy in the past, here are some options that may help you secure a home improvement loan with less than stellar credit history.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> Private Lending Sources</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple Internet search will provide you with pages of private lending companies that specialize in helping borrowers get approved for home improvement loans with bad credit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you fill out a loan request form for any of the private lending companies that look promising, be sure to check with your state’s mortgage broker licensing board about the lending firm’s reputation. Most private lending sources are restricted to conducting business within their region or state and have fairly short repayment terms, but these lenders often approve applicants quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> Government Home Improvement Programs</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Specific government programs such as the FHA Title I Property Improvement Loan program or the Section 203(k) Rehab Mortgage Insurance loan are programs that help homeowners with the costs of renovating their homes. FHA Title I loans are issued by private lenders but insured by the federal government in case the homeowner defaults on the loan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Section 203(k) Rehab Mortgage Insurance loan allows a borrower to finance renovating his or her existing home through a single mortgage or special financing. Information on both home renovation loans can be found at http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/topics/home_improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> Credit Unions</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you belong to a local credit union, you may qualify for a bad credit home improvement loan. All credit unions offer specific programs to help their members acquire specialized loans regardless of their low credit scores. Credit unions were not established to make a profit off of their members, so their credit score requirements are less stringent than the credit score requirements for a typical bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, a credit union looks closely at how long a member has been with the credit union and how well a member has paid off previous loans with the credit union. If you are not part of a credit union and would like to join one, findacreditunion.com is a site that locates credit unions in your area. Credit unions are independent nonprofit organizations, so it is best to compare interest rates from several of them before committing to a home improvement loan payment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> Calculate the Costs of Home Renovations</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Before committing to one of the loan options mentioned, you should calculate how much the materials and contractor will cost for the home improvements you intend to carry out. After you take an assessment of the renovation costs, make sure the improvements increase the value of your home, the monthly loan payments are affordable, and the loan’s interest is tax deductible.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>After you read this you will know the steps to consider for people with low credit scores when buying a home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having bad credit doesn’t mean you can’t buy a home and have an affordable mortgage with low interest rates. You may not be able to plunge directly into the market as you’d like to, but by employing some simple and smart saving techniques and doing your research, you’ll be able to find a place that both embodies what you envision in a home and doesn’t break your bank account.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3> Top 3 Steps for Bad Credit Home Buyers</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Step 1: Establish a budget</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><br> This seems like a very obvious idea, but in reality, many people don’t take the time to sit down and calculate a detailed budget. A rough estimate of what you can afford to put down on a house and how much you think you can spend per month on a mortgage payment isn’t a wise idea. Instead, take an afternoon to sit down and analyze bank statements, find out how much you earn annually and deduct utilities, living expenses (groceries, car payments, etc.) and then use that exact number to decide how much you could spend each month while still having a sufficient amount to spare and live comfortably.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Step 2: Begin Saving</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><br> If you have bad credit, finding a home mortgage loan that doesn’t have exuberant interest rates will be a challenge. In order to establish validity, you should save up for as much as the down payment as possible before you even apply. Current mortgage rates dictate that the the average down payment for a house is 20 percent of the cost, so this will mean pinching pennies and maybe taking up additional jobs if you want to expedite the process. Saving up thousands of dollars does take a while, but it also gives you time to not just continue making consistent payments on outstanding debts that will in turn raise your credit score, but also formulate a solid idea of what type of house you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 3: Look for Bad Credit Loan Companies<br> If you have been saving, making payments and still find yourself with a bad score that might get you declined for a mortgage, then you can look into companies that offer loans for people with low credit scores. The Federal Housing Administration is the most reputable and suggested company for people with bad credit. They issue government-backed loans to qualifying applicants and feature some of the best mortgage rates for people with bad credit with only 3.5 percent of the settled cost required in contrast to the standard 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> Summary</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, the mortgage rates for people with bad credit are usually only altered by either increased credit score or having a large sum of money available for the down payment. Having to take extra measures for saving may be frustrating, but it will give you a sense of fiscal responsibility and discipline that you can carry on even after you’ve found a house and use to raise your credit score higher and relieve yourself of debt.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>(Disclaimer: This article is not intended to be legal advice. Please consult a bankruptcy attorney prior to making any legal decisions.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filing bankruptcy is not only a last resort legal action; it is also a very complicated legal action that definitely needs the expertise of a lawyer. When thinking about bankruptcy, you first need to decide if bankruptcy is right for you. If it is, then you need the help of an attorney to decide which type of bankruptcy is required for your particular situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to file bankruptcy can be brought on by many different circumstances. The most common circumstances are divorce, medical hardships and credit card troubles. In cases of divorce, bankruptcy is often inevitable. The sudden change in financial level and the added burden of court costs, extra expenses and child support often cause one or both parties to get behind on their financial obligations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of medical hardships, high medical bills can sometimes overburden people even if they have insurance. This is even more likely to happen if the person experiencing the medical emergency is also the family breadwinner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common case of financial hardship is incredibly high credit card balances. After carrying numerous high credit balances for a certain period of time, many people find themselves unable to make anything but the minimum payment and sometimes not even being able to make that. Then, when the high interest rates are added in, people find themselves in a situation where repayment is often impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether your situation arose from one of the above financial problems or not, sometimes bankruptcy is the only answer to your monetary problems. Once you have decided that bankruptcy is the answer for you, you will need to enlist the services of a lawyer to decide which type of bankruptcy to file and to help you navigate the many complex bankruptcy laws and regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are four main types of bankruptcy, Chapter 7, Chapter 13, Chapter 11 and Chapter 12. Chapter 7 is the most common form and can be used by businesses and individuals. Chapter 13 is the second most common form, but it is limited to use by individuals only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a debtor&#8217;s property is divided into to categories, exempt and non-exempt. Exempt properties include things that the debtor will be allowed to keep like their home and automobile. In the case of exempt properties, the debtor is allowed to keep them as long as he or she continues to pay for them. If a person cannot continue to make payments, the owner of the loan may repossess the property, even after a bankruptcy has been finalized. Any non-exempt or unsecured property will be sold to cover the debtor&#8217;s financial obligations. Debts such as credit card debts and medical bills can be written off with this type of bankruptcy, but other debts like school loans and taxes cannot be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the debtor is required to come up with a way to repay his or her debts, but these debts usually do not have to be repaid in full. In most cases, a creditor will agree to take a small percentage of the owed debt as opposed to losing all repayment all together. This form of bankruptcy is preferable for those individuals that wish to keep all of their possessions and just need a chance to catch up on their financial obligations. It does not, however, excuse a debtor from priority debts like taxes and child support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to qualify for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, an individual must have a yearly income level that allows for repayment of each of his debts within three to five years. After three to five years of consistent repayment, the debtor&#8217;s obligations are released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have researched bankruptcy and decided that it is right for you, you need to contact an attorney that specializes in bankruptcy to help assure that you follow all legal guidelines and are protected from further collection activity. </p>\n",

In most cases, a creditor will agree to take a small percentage of the owed debt as opposed to losing all repayment all together. This form of bankruptcy is preferable for those individuals that wish to keep all of their possessions and just need a chance to catch up on their financial obligations. It does not, however, excuse a debtor from priority debts like taxes and child support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to qualify for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, an individual must have a yearly income level that allows for repayment of each of his debts within three to five years. After three to five years of consistent repayment, the debtor&#8217;s obligations are released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have researched bankruptcy and decided that it is right for you, you need to contact an attorney that specializes in bankruptcy to help assure that you follow all legal guidelines and are protected from further collection activity.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Applying for a hard money or subprime mortgage loan online can seem intimidating at first. With so many regional lenders to choose from, it can appear difficult to find the best mortgage loan. However, online hard money, private money, and subprime lenders allow you to search online for rates, compare financing options, and avoid falling prey to predatory lenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What To Expect</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your financial situation, you should expect to pay 5-10 percent higher than the prime loan rate. You will also pay some fees that should add up to no more than 10% of your mortgage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online hard money and subprime lenders offer all the same services of a traditional bank, but through the convenience of the internet. You can request quotes, ask questions, or apply for your mortgage loan online.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Searching For Rates</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With online hard, private, and subprime lenders, it is difficult to find online quotes. Mortgage lending websites can offer you quotes from conventional lenders, but so much is case dependent with hard, private, and subprime lending programs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, instant mortgage quotes come from only the most basic information that you provide, meaning they aren&#8217;t always accurate. But, this is a quick way to learn which mortgage lenders offer the best rates. This is also an easy way to weed out the predatory lenders with their excessively high rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Picking A Lender</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick at least three lenders you believe are competitive and request a formal quote from them. Typically, you will need to fill out an online application, providing information about your income, property’s location, and other such details. All of the information requested are factors that mortgage lenders use to determine your rate. With our service you only need to fill out one loan request form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you receive quotes, take the time to review their offers. Add in the cost of loan fees as well as the interest you will pay to determine the total cost of the loan. Consider how long a term you will borrow the money for. The longer your loan term the more points are typically charged. When you have decided on an offer, you can quickly finish the application process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Applying Online</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Applying for an online mortgage loan is practically the same thing as requesting a rate quote. Some mortgage lenders will require you to complete your information online; others will send you paperwork to complete and fax in.</p>\n",

A good application of this would be a commercial development or a subdivision. The blanket mortgage covers the entire thing during construction, and then a release is obtained for each parcel as it is sold off. A release clause must be built into the blanket mortgage that allows the developer to sell off each unit of the property as long as certain percentage of the entire debt is paid off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blanket mortgage is a way to do all of your financing with one mortgage application. It covers both current properties that can be used as collateral and potential properties that will arise once a plot of land is developed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individual homeowners can use blanket mortgages to cover construction of a new home while they are trying to sell their existing property. Once the old property is sold off, the blanket loan is reduced by the dollar amount of equity in the previous home. Some lenders will allow you to pay interest only on the amount that is budgeted for construction of the new property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private mortgage lenders often are willing to make blanket mortgages because they are mainly interested in how much equity collateral is protecting their investment.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>No one dreams of opening a restaurant or shop so that they can spend hours staring at accounts payable and receivable columns. Many entrepreneurs and small business owners can benefit from having an extra hand balancing the books, but they may be unsure about outsourcing to an accounting firm. Experts recommend hiring a professional accountant once a business has around 25-30 employees or revenue above $1 million, but many organizations can benefit from bookkeeping help much sooner than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Budgeting</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting and sticking to a budget is a challenge for any team, so having an outside look at the income and outflow of cash can be extremely helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Taxes</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Monthly and quarterly taxes can be complicated. From withholding federal and state taxes for employees and preparing an end-of-the-year tax return to facilitating an audit, this is sure to be one of the most useful services offered by a firm. Also, the accountant may also help set up tax software systems as well as auditing software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By automating these processes, the need for a full-time bookkeeper is eliminated making the cost of consulting with a firm less expensive than keeping an employee on staff.<br>\nAdvice</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advice offered by an accounting firm is especially useful for newer business owners who have never had to manage large-scale financial operations. An accountant can be a valuable resource for advice on financial strategies, how to maximize tax breaks, investment of business resources, and risk management. Accountants can also provide insight into the depreciation of equipment and other assets, which is important in a final valuation. Click here !<br>\nRegulations</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a tech-savvy entrepreneur might know every programming code under the sun, he or she may have absolutely no knowledge of the tax code or other business regulations. Having an accountant available can help ensure that the business operates legally and does not incur any fines. If any of these regulations change, the business will be notified and advised on how to incorporate necessary adjustments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> Forensic Accounting</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If a business owner suspects that one of his or her employees has been committing fraud, an accounting firm can investigate to see if there is a paper trail. This is called forensic accounting. In addition to the benefit found in having experts examine the books, this also helps to avoid any appearance of bias or impropriety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how large or small, every company can benefit from the knowledge, advice, and services offered by an accounting firm. To establish a customized service plan, a company’s owners or general management should set up a consultation with a financial advisor that has a solid reputation and a proven history of success.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>When going through court litigations, there are certain aspects that cannot be handled by the lawyer alone. This is especially true when going into fiscal details that are better understood and analyzed by the financial expert witness, an individual whose career revolves around money management. Here are some instances that would require their assistance.<br>\nReparation Estimates</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In cases demanding compensation, a financial expert can justify the monetary value owed. The expert can provide and explain the necessary documents that will rationalize the cost being reported. Regardless of the educational attainment and arithmetic ability of the client, a qualified financial specialist may be needed especially in computing conservative mathematical assumptions and uncovering compelling past, present and future losses.<br>\nDamage Validity</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When looking at the opposite side of the coin, a financial authority is the ideal person to call in to substantiate the claims being made. He or she can corroborate or refute any declarations made by the other side. The court is most likely to side with the judgment of an independent financial expert witness rather than that of a disgruntled complainant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Best Times to Use a Financial Expert Witness</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The plaintiff may be the best man to enumerate his actual expenses or earnings, but only a well-rounded and experienced financial expert witness can put a price to intangible or unrealized values. These potential proportions could include employee benefits, insurance claims and other foreseeable incidents that may have been denied or are inaccessible due to the circumstances leading to the trial.<br>\nPecuniary Translations</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most judges and juries will not be able to decipher the significance or insignificance of all the values presented in income statements and reports for restitution. It is the burden of the financial expert witness to properly appraise any and all computations, enlighten the court of law on such calculations, and uphold reason and fair judgment for the entirety of the hearing. Provided he passes cross-examination, his assessment will hold the most weight.<br>\nUpon deciding on the services of a financial expert witness, one must look for a reliable and scrupulous individual. Look for someone with experience and adequate educational and employment backgrounds on the specifics of the suit. With a good expert on the team, the firm is a step towards being ultimately assured of a solid case, commendable judicious practices, and an expedited hearing. He or she will help win the case, bring acclaim to the practice, and return the client back to real life.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Over the years, the mortgage rates in the USA have suffered upheavals and were subjected to undulating behavioral patterns quite often. This anomaly started ever since the subprime mortgage crisis led to the economic meltdown the world over, especially the US and sent ripple effects to the other nations. In this article we will highlight upon the mortgage rates in USA and Canada and find out the prevailing condition of the same. So, read on for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Mortgage rates in United States</strong></p>\n<p>Average US rate on fixed mortgage for the 30 year loan period manifested an escalation in the ongoing week. This manifestation comes after the mortgage rates for fixed 30-years were at an all time low as witnessed in the last 11 weeks. As per statement made by the eminent mortgage buyer Freddie Mac, the mortgage rates escalated to 3.55% from 3.49% in the last week. This all time low occurred way back during the 1950s. As far as refinancing is concerned, for the 15-year fixed mortgage, the mortgage rates increased from 2.80% to 2.83%.</p>\n<p>Due to the affordable mortgage rates, the housing market was able to recover to some extent this year, although the recovery was not consistent as expected. There were very few takers of new homes during the months of June and it was found that as compared to May, the sale was even less in the month of June. However, it has been observed that the prices of homes have started escalating in many cities.</p>\n<p>It has been suggested that it is quite likely that due to the declining job market, there are not many buyers. One of the reasons why mortgage rates have been nose diving is due to the fact that these rates keep tab on yield on 10-year Treasury note.</p>\n<p><strong>Mortgage rates in Canada</strong></p>\n<p>It has been almost a month when the stringent rules related to lending and insured mortgage have been announced. The mortgage rates in Canada are nose diving alarmingly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For 5-year fixed mortgage rates in Canada, it was found that it was 2.89%. However, the rates will differ to some extent from one lender to another taking into account the processing fees and service charges.</li>\n<li>For 5-year Variable mortgage rates, it was found to be 2.65%.</li>\n<li>In case of 3-year fixed mortgage rates in Canada, it was recorded as 2.69%</li>\n<li>If you are looking forward to 3-year Variable mortgage rates, it is 2.90%</li>\n<li>Finally in case of 10-year fixed mortgage rates, it is 3.79%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember the mortgage rates in Canada as mentioned above are updated mortgage rates as of August 2nd 2012.</p>\n<p>An interesting observation related to mortgage rates in Canada is that in all this hullaballoo, the banks prefer to stay out of all this. And this is being done so that the Federal Department of Finance is not disappointed. It may be mentioned here that over the months, the Department of Finance has been concerned about the rising consumer debt especially in cities like Montreal, Vancouver, and Toronto.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Buying a car is doubtless the most costly single purchase you’ll ever make after your house. This is why many people elect for purchasing <strong>cars on finance</strong> just as they do with their house. Car finance is different from your mortgage, as there is less regulation, more hazards, and more room to be scammed by some devious car dealer. You need to go into car finance fully knowledgeable and with your eyes open.</p>\n<p>Getting cars on finance should not have to be a nightmare if you know what you are doing. The secret to procuring a car is all in the groundwork. Most of the hard work happens prior to you even stepping foot in a car dealership. Before you walk into a car dealership, you should have all of your facts and most importantly your funding in sequence before you ever sit down with the agent. This will enable you to be in control of the situation.</p>\n<p>Before you even think about getting <strong>cars on finance</strong>, you should find out as much as you can about the procedure and know what to anticipate when you walk into the dealership. Know what the going interest rate is, and remember, it may be cheaper to purchase, however, interest rate on a used car will be much higher than a new car. Know what the invoice cost is on the vehicle that you want to buy. You can start this by going online and looking at prices of the cars that you are attracted. Be cognizant of the many things that dealers will try to offer you when it is time to close the deal on your new car such as gap insurance, extended warranties, paint protection and many extras that dealers will try to add on to the cost of your loan.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is to have as much facts and figures as possible before you consider getting <strong>cars on finance</strong>. If you are not prepared and in control you won’t stand a chance when you walk into a car dealership. A slick talking car dealer will talk you into signing your first-born away. Have the upper hand when it comes to buying your next car.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>For most of us, a car is essential for everyday life, particularly if we don’t live in a big city or have access to shared transport. However, the reality is that many people have gained bad credit scores and lenders have tightened up their acceptance criteria massively, as the economic downturn has begun to truly bite. There are ways to get around the problem and secure finance to purchase your next car.</p>\n<p>Firstly, get your credit report from Experian or other provider sites. It’s just a few dollars, but take care to just order your report from one of these agencies. It shows up as a credit check each time and will further impact your score if you repeatedly order it.</p>\n<p>Then review it and check for outstanding loans. You may need to pay these off first. Cancel any unused credit cards, close old store accounts and generally show that you are administering your finances well. If you have payment delay histories or missed payments, ensure that for three months at least, you stick to every payment faithfully. Sign in to the electoral register and provide a permanent address to give lenders some security. If there are mistakes or items you wish to contest on your report, ask for a note to be added.</p>\n<p>Check your FICO score on the report. Banks use these scores to rate applicants and you need about 600-700 generally to be accepted. If your score is under 550, don’t try to apply for credit, try to repair your score first. Speak to a debt advisor for assistance, ideally through a government sponsored or charitable scheme.</p>\n<p>Look at a specialist lender for bad credit, such as Car Finance with Bad Credit that will have products that match your particular needs and be more willing to accept your particular risk profile.</p>\n<p>Save up a decent deposit, as the more you have the better and it reflects well for the lender. Also, make sure you have read up on the latest interest rates on offer in the market before heading to the car lot, so you know what sort of offers there are.</p>\n<p>When at the car lot, bring your credit report with you and speak to the sub-prime credit department if they have one. Show that you’re taking the purchase seriously and are committed to managing the loan well. Show this too by selecting a car that you can afford. Don’t overstretch yourself or go for looks. It needs to be functional, but not fancy. Listen carefully to the salesperson too, so you know what details you’re getting on the loan. If you’ve done your research, you won’t be fooled into taking a terrible deal!</p>\n<p>Once you do have the car in your possession, make sure you keep very closely to the terms of the loan and repay every month on time, so that when the car finally expires, along with your loan, you’ll be in a far better position to get the car you want at the right price in future.</p>\n",

From the things, they have to buy like groceries to the things that they like to do such as read books and magazines, all of these activities can be done on little money or even free.</p>\n<p><em>Purchase Term Life Insurance</em></p>\n<p>Purchasing life insurance is a very good idea because it keeps the family in their homes after they have lost their main breadwinner. However, people believe that it would be a luxury to purchase life insurance. Term life insurance is the answer to this dilemma because term life insurance is the most affordable type of life insurance.</p>\n<p>With term life insurance, policyholders will insure their lives for a set number of years. If they pass away during the term, the people they named as beneficiaries receive a lump sum of money to pay their mortgages pay off student loans, pay credit card debts or fund for college educations.</p>\n<p><em>Buy Necessities at the Discount Stores</em></p>\n<p>purchasing groceries from a discount store is a great way for people with several mouths to feed to buy a good amount of food for a lower price. These types of stores typically sell their products in bulk, and it includes food as well as paper products such as toilet paper. People with large families need these products in large numbers and if they were to go to the local grocery stores, they would have to pay much more.</p>\n<p><em>Look for Coupons Online</em></p>\n<p>People with large families who need to watch the amount of money they are spending don’t have to give up going to the restaurants they like. The Internet is full of websites that cater to people who are searching for coupons. They can also find coupons for their favorite restaurants on the restaurants’ websites; they may even find good deals for when they can take their kids to eat free.</p>\n<p><em>Visit the Libraries for Entertainment</em></p>\n<p>the libraries are a place where people can find their entertainment free as long as they return their materials on time when they are due. Libraries have more than just books. If people are looking for the latest music, they will find it in the library and is a place where they can obtain DVDs. With movies costing around $10 per person, taking a large family out for a movie can cost a small fortune, and that is before they have purchased the popcorn. Checking out DVDs at the library eliminates the temptation to spend so much money on the movies.</p>\n<p><em>Shop at the Thrift Stores</em></p>\n<p>With a large number of people to clothe, families can find their clothing bills to be very high if they are taking everyone to the local malls for their school or work clothing. A less expensive alternative is the thrift shop. People can find great, fashionable items at the thrift store, and offered for a price that is much lower than the prices they will find at the malls.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Plastic money is long ago a major means of financial exchange, especially since manufacturers, companies and most businessmen have come up with many ways customers could benefit (and of course themselves) from your shopping while using a credit card: discounts, bargains, bonuses and so on.</p>\n<p>Credit cards tend to get more difficult to get issued and banks and other similar institutes have tightened their requirements, so <strong>credit cards for people with bad credit</strong> seem a bit farfetched.</p>\n<p>In order to <strong>get a credit card</strong> for the first time, it is often advised to apply at the bank you have a checking account, since banks or credit unions are more receptive in their own customers’ credit applications. If you haven’t bounced any checks and you are employed, then the odds get higher to <strong>get a credit card</strong>.</p>\n<p>Another easy way to <strong>get a credit card</strong> is to get it from a department store or a retailer. They aren’t beneficial to you as their interest rates tend to be much higher, but you wouldn’t have difficulties in getting them, plus you will be able to built a credit history in 6-12 months. Once you have a good credit history of prompt payments you can easily apply for a MasterCard or a Visa.</p>\n<p>Of course, <strong>credit cards for people with bad credit</strong> are more hard to get, although there are options there too. The best way to be accepted for a credit card under such poor credit conditions is to apply for a secured credit card. Secured credit cards are more modestly priced and also give you the chance to shift into unsecured credit cards a lot quicker, if only you pay at least the minimum payment steadily every month.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>In the era of debit card and easily accessible cash through the ATMs, we all expected credit card to be obsolete in course of time. However, it still exists! This is because some of the consumers spend more than they earn with the help of plastic. In the mean time, people who exercised financial discipline changed their spending pattern, as they preferred cash over credit card. In this situation, the credit card companies introduced reward programs to keep their customers, those who don’t overspend, using their plastic.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the extra perks offered by the credit card companies to pep up the financial life of their customers by helping them make and save some extra cash:</p>\n<h3>1. Cash Back reward</h3>\n<p>The cash reward programs may provide you a refund in the form of a check when you use the credit card to purchase stuffs. There are credit cards that offer 6% cash back on groceries, 3% on gas, and 1% on all other purchases. Well, the card companies charge an annual fee of $75, so evaluate the charge against what you expect to earn in refund before application.</p>\n<p>However, you need to exercise financial discipline and pay off your bills on time. Rewards can be excellent perks to pep up your financial life, make sure you excise financial discipline to avoid getting ensnared in debt.</p>\n<h3>2. Travel benefits</h3>\n<p>Most of the credit cards offer free car rental insurance, discounts on airline purchases and reduced rate hotel rooms. If you’re frequently traveling, then these rewards can be beneficial for you. Along with the credit card offers you can take advantage of the discount offers of the vendors. As a result, you can manage to save double while you’re traveling.</p>\n<h3>3. Guaranteed percentage of return</h3>\n<p>You can find a card that offers refund if you use your credit card to purchase an item, and you find the same item on a reduced price elsewhere. There are cards that may offer “price protection.” These cards offer their cardholders grace period after making a purchase to claim your money back if the price of the product is lowered some elsewhere. Before you apply for this type of card, make sure you read the terms and conditions sincerely, to avoid complications in future.</p>\n<h3>4. Apply for a product protection card</h3>\n<p>You can find some cards that offer “product protection”. If you use the card to buy a product, the company can refund you for the price of the item if it’s lost or stolen. Well, before you apply for this type of card, make sure you read the terms and conditions on the card. Make sure you find out from the credit card company whether or not you’ve to claim this reward. Make sure you find out if there is any built-in insurance policy courtesy of your credit card company, before applying.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you apply any one of these types of cards, then you can manage to save and make some extra cash. But you need to exercise financial discipline if you’re using your cards frequently to avoid financial complications in future. Unfortunately, if you incur overwhelming debts, you can enroll in a credit card debt consolidation program to eliminate your financial woes.</p>\n",
